headquarters of Acquisitions Incorporated. 

Personal Life
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Calador went to wizarding school in an attempt to gain favor from his
family, much like his oldest brother `Faen. <appendix_b.html#grand-vizer-faen>`__

Adventurer’s Backstory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Calador found The Bone of Dorsain - a legendary magical artifact used to
worship the Ouroboros Snake in the cult temple of life, death, and
rebirth The Ouroboros Temple. He met the adventuring party when Winsom
Landy hired the adventurers to help escort a magical artifact back to
civilization for identification and eventual resell.

`The Bone of Doresain, <items.html#the-bone-of-doresain>`__ however, was full of incredibly potent necrotic
energy and eventually drove Calador mad, causing him to crave humanoid
flesh. Throughout the adventure her turned all of his compatriots into
ghouls under his control.

After being defeated by The Hot Mess of Brie team, he was brought back
from the beyond as a spectre by `Jim Darkmagic <appendix_b.html#jim-darkmagic>`__ (as a kind of cruel joke
or otherwise) to perform as the Guild Administrator for The Hot Mess of
Brie.

He is not well known to do his administrative duties effectively. He
also refers to all those living inside `The Ouroboros Temple
(Headquarters) <other_locations.html#the-ouroboros-temple-original>`__ as trespassers.

Jim Darkmagic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Have a magical day!

Jim Winifred Darkmagic III is the scion of a mysterious, multiplanar
wizarding family. Jim’s arcane pedigree has long preceded him,
incorporating equally healthy amounts of magical training and innate
eldritch prowess. However, despite a natural talent that could have
allowed him to make a name for himself as a court wizard, or perhaps
“that strange old man in the village,” Jim’s original penchant was not
for the magic of scroll or spell, but for the stage.

As an entertainer and purveyor of the “Jim Darkmagic Experience,” the
legendary mage can often be found in markets and town squares,
performing features of mundane legerdemain. The renown he has earned for
these feats is nearly equaled by the reputation that follows him as
chief arcanist (and occasional arsonist) for Acquisitions Incorporated.
And although his skills as an adventurer and real wizard remain highly
sought after, Jim looks forward to a well-earned retirement, at which
point he hopes to become a “real wizard” -- by which he means a fake
wizard -- full time.

Jim Darkmagic (High Elf) is the owner/CEO of the Acquisitions
Incorporated (AI) company, which franchised Hot Mess of Brie out of the
city of Kasoon

Not much is known about Jim Darkmagic other than he is a very powerful
wizard, known for using the magic at-will to momentarily inconvenience
other during regular conversations. Additionally Darkmagic has been
known to perform powerful ritualistic magic. In the beginning of the
Incorporation of Hot Mess of Brie, he and a few other mages teleported
the entire Ouroboros Temple to the city of `Kassoon <notable_cities.html#kassoon>`__ to make it more
readily accessible to a town.

Jim Darkmagic publicly resents the influence that `The Grand Vizer Faen <appendix_b.html#grand-vizer-faen>`__
has on all local politics (and thus AI)

Jolruzai Runzehr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overseer of plant sales and assassinations merchant lord in `Kassoon. <notable_cities.html#kassoon>`__

Informed by `Kirnih Oceantalon <appendix_b.html#kirnih-oceantalon>`__, 
owner of `A Florist’s Delight, <notable_cities.html#a-florists-delight>`__ 
that `Boxwood Clovers <notable_cities.html#boxwood-clovers>`__ was a new, 
unregulated business on the scene. In response, she
tightened import regulations and sent agents undercover to threaten
`Tifter <appendix_b.html#tifter-and-tiffany-valeure>`__ into submitting 
to her commercial control. When nothing changed,
it was `Zhanti <appendix_b.html#zhanti>`__ who convinced her to do nothing. In exchange for tax-free
armour for her assassins, Jolruzai would no longer interfere with `Boxwood Clovers. <notable_cities.html#boxwood-clovers>`__

Jolruzai grew more frustrated that a new business (that she didn’t
control) was hoarding a big proportion of the plant market’s money. With
a little persuasion from the local stall holders, she granted `Kirnih <appendix_b.html#kirnih-oceantalon>`__
a sanction to kill `Tifter <appendix_b.html#tifter-and-tiffany-valeure>`__ 
by poison, her specialty. `Kirnih's <appendix_b.html#kirnih-oceantalon>`__ 
poison, however, only sent `Tifter <appendix_b.html#tifter-and-tiffany-valeure>`__ to sleep.

Kirnih Oceantalon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Owner** of `A Florist’s Delight <notable_cities.html#a-florists-delight>`__ 
and member of `Daermon N'a'shezbaernon. <religions_and_organizations.html#daermon-n-a-shezbaernon>`__

Kirnih is a very gifted poison crafter and largely produces poisons to
`Jolruzai’s <appendix_b.html#jolruzai-runzehr>`__ assasination business.

She was granted a sanction to kill `Tifter <appendix_b.html#tifter-and-tiffany-valeure>`__ by poison, her specialty.
Kirnih’s poison, however, only sent Tifter to sleep.

Kraz

Kraz is a hobgoblin pack leader that the `Adventurers <adventurers.html>`__ encountered in
`Havel’s Crossing. <other_locations.html#havels-crossing>`__ `Kadar <adventurers.html#kadar>`__

leave the inn without even taking their weapons along.

woman interested only in her greed and momentary whims.

`The Tomb of the Meridian Lord <other_locations.html#the-tomb-of-the-meridian-lord>`__ 
for her own burial site, she was rescued by the Hot Mess of Brie adventurers
and returned safely to her husband. She now appreciates what they have
to offer skill-wise, if only barely.

Roris Keuras
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Employee of `Ella Bafflestone <appendix_b.html#ella-bafflestone>`__ at `Herb's Garden <notable_cities.html#herbs-garden>`__ looking to quit the apothecary lifestyle and move onto bigger and better things as a grand artificer and enchanter.

`Gryzar <adventurers.html#gryzar-bloodforge>`__ then took up his father's axe
and started a quest of vengeance.


Tifter and Tiffany Valeure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tifter and Tiffany were born to middle class human parents Hortiff and
Yasmina Valeure, two mercenaries stationed in the city of Waterdeep. The
jobs paid well, and so the two children never wanted for anything. It
had always been a family tradition that when a child comes of age (18),
they must flee the nest to train at another mercenary encampment,
believing that a new “cultural experience” is good for the soul.

Tifter was never a good soldier – he was too busy jumping on the newest
bandwagon for personal glory to worry about the “greater good”. However,
to ensure a good allowance was maintained from his parents, he agreed to
travel to the Flaming Fist Camp in `Kernwith Keep <other_locations.html#kernwith-keep>`__ 
to “really make a difference to the impoverished peninsula”. Tifter never made it to
`Kernwith Keep, <other_locations.html#kernwith-keep>`__ instead enamoured 
by the commerce and excitement of `Kassoon. <notable_cities.html#kassoon>`__ 
He decided to open a flower shop selling Boxwood Clovers. The clovers were
a hit with the locals, quickly becoming known for its beautiful scent and 
unique colourings. Tifter set up shop in the `Kassoon. <notable_cities.html#kassoon>`__
town center the place to be if you were going to sell anything.  

Tifter met `Kris Dicant, <appendix_b.html#krissa-dicant>`__ a traveller “looking for work”. Their
relationship quickly spiralled from there. First lovers and then
friends, the pair ended up becoming business partners for the successful
shop, now named `Boxwood Clovers. <notable_cities.html#boxwood-clovers>`__ 
As Tifter’s luck would have it, `Kris <appendix_b.html#krissa-dicant>`__ is
in fact a member of 
`Daermon N'a'shezbaernon, <religions_and_organizations.html#daermon-n-a-shezbaernon>`__  
an underground spy network seeking wealth wherever they can. `Kris, <appendix_b.html#krissa-dicant>`__ 
themself is part of the search for the `Ring of Frost, <items.html#ring-of-frost>`__ 
a magical item rumoured to render someone invincible. When they realised the 
search was fruitless, they decided to park the endeavour for a bit to focus on 
something more interesting – money. `Boxwood Clovers. <notable_cities.html#boxwood-clovers>`__ 
had unfortunately had a few robberies in recent months, and Tifter had been followed 
home on a number of occasions by people trying to find out where the stash 
of flowers was stored. 

Eventually it was decided that the shop needed protection – `Kris <appendix_b.html#krissa-dicant>`__ 
quickly provided 9 guards for the work.

Winsom Landy
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quest giver that hired 
`HMOB <religions_and_organizations.html#hot-mess-of-brie>`__ to escort a found 
magical artifact back to civilization. After accompanything the heroes to 
`The Ouroboros Temple (Original), <other_locations.html#the-ouroboros-temple-original>`__ 
she rushed ahead of the adventurers and was murdered by
`Calador <appendix_b.html#calador>`__ and turned into a ghoul.

Zhanti
~~~~~~

Merchant lord. Overseer of armour sales and a member of both the secret
`Ytepka Society <religions_and_organizations.html#ytepka-society>`__ and 
`Daermon N'a'shezbaernon, <religions_and_organizations.html#daermon-n-a-shezbaernon>`__
in `Kassoon. <notable_cities.html#kassoon>`__

Principal motivation as a merchant lord after money is restoring moral
order through the peninsula’s secret 
`Ytepka Society. <religions_and_organizations.html#ytepka-society>`__ 
She’s one of the society’s contacts with 
`Daermon N'a'shezbaernon, <religions_and_organizations.html#daermon-n-a-shezbaernon>`__ 
and has thus been working with `Kris Dicant <appendix_b.html#krissa-dicant>`__ to 
establish trust before weeding her way in further.

Zhanti protected `Boxwood Clovers <notable_cities.html#boxwood-clovers>`__ 
from `Jolruzai <appendix_b.html#jolruzai-runzehr>`__ by offering a favorable
trade in exchange for no longer looking to extract money from the
business. Zhanti had found the taste for money again and began to demand
a percentage of profits from the business. While `Kris <appendix_b.html#krissa-dicant>`__ 
remained strong at first, their resolve weakened and they began to feel the pressure to
earn more money.
