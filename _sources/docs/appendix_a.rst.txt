It’s a Rental 
    At **Rank 1**, at the start of any mission, you can requisition a
    second-hand draft horse and cart (barely functional), riding horses and
    ponies (typically well aged, one for each party member), passage on a
    ship or ferry (might require minor labor as a part of the fare), and
    similar transportation. Any damage or losses to requisitioned equipment
    is expected to be repaid to Head Office.

Spyglass of Clairvoyance
    A common magic item given to a cartographer by the Head Office of
    Acquisitions Incorporated. As an action, you can look through the
    spyglass of clairvoyance at a location within 1 mile of you that is
    obstructing your view, such as a mountain, castle, or forest. You must
    then succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom check using cartographer’s tools to map
    the natural terrain found within three miles of that chosen point. You
    do not gain any knowledge of creatures, structures, or anything other
    than natural terrain. This property of the spyglass cannot be used again
    until the next dawn.

Tale of Safe Travel
    Starting at **Rank 2**, you gain the ability to perform a 45-minute
    ritual using your cartographer’s tools, maps, and 50gp in consumed
    material components. By doing so, you ensure safe travel for you and
    other creatures, from your current location to another location you
    could normally reach within one day The destination must be one to which
    you have traveled previously, or for which you have an accurate route
    and map. If your tale is told with reverence and precision, you and up
    to six other creatures plus their gear (including vehicles or mounts)
    become encircled in a magical bubble and are pulled into the Border
    Ethereal. During the ritual, you tell a story of your future journey,
    relating the details of what will be seen en route. The DM can choose to
    add to the story, imparting additional details or planting seeds for
    future adventures. If you wish, the ritual can be ended early, allowing
    the party to encounter what’s being described by the DM. Whenever the
    ritual is ended or interrupted by you, all the travelers arrive safely
    at the destination. At the DM’s discretion, all the travelers affected
    by the ritual can gain the benefit of either a short rest or a long rest
    during the voyage.

Map of Shortcuts
    At **Rank 3**, your map case becomes a common magic item. In addition to
    storing normal maps, your cartographer’s map case can be used to
    generate a special map identifying a shortcut. You can use your action
    to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, with a success revealing a
    map buried in your cartographer’s map case noting a relevant shortcut.
    Your travel time is reduced by half while you follow the route. If you
    succeed at a check by 5 or map, the map includes notes on terrain giving
    you advantage on the next ability check you make through the mapped area
    in the next hour. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again
    until you finish a long rest.

Map of the Moment
    Starting at **Rank 3**, you can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom
    (Perception) check and search your cartographer’s map case to find a map
    either related to your current mission or inspiring a new one. On a
    success, you find a map with a prominent landmark. The map has
    information on the natural terrain within one mile of the landmark. Once
    you use this feature, you cannot use it again until dawn seven days
    later.

Elder Cartographer’s Glossography 
    When you attain **Rank 4**, you gain a small tome that is an uncommon
    magic item. *The Elder Cartographer’s Glossography* grants advantage on
    Intelligence or Wisdom saving checks related to geographical features or
    locations.

Greater Tale of Safe Travel
    Also at **Rank 4**, your Tale of Safe Travel feature can now span up to
    three days of travel. If your franchise headquarters is mobile, you can
    include it in your Tale of Safe Travel, and can also include items or
    goods weighing up to 2,000 pounds.

+----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Decisionist
===========

    A decisionist brings decisive leadership to an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. They settle
    disputes and ensure that the team moves forward towards its goals, often serving as a
    leader (officially or otherwise) and compass for the party. A signature move of the decisionist
    is to impress the importance of a particular looming choice on the other franchisees, then call
    for a vote. The result of all franchise votes are recorded, then later reported to Head Office.
    Decisionists are also concerned with franchise morale and teamwork, helping all members of the
    franchise work together effectively.

    All decisionists vary in their approach to the task. You might primarily attempt to convince
    others through charismatic arguments, or through force of will or intellectual cunning. You
    might lead by example, or by extolling the examples of other people who've done the things you
    haven't quite gotten around to yet. Many decisionists go on to publish famous tomes, such as the
    best-selling *Habits of Effective Adventuring Parties* and *I Don't Care If the Rogue Stole Your
    Coins, We Have a Job to Do.* You help advance the franchise by calling for votes, making sure
    you're always on the side with the most votes, and resolving disputes within the franchise
    party.

Essential Functions:
    Receive one extra vote on franchise matters; resolve interpersonal conflicts

Position Proficiency:
    In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can add your proficiency bonus to an ability
    check to influence a decision being made by a group, assess the popularity of certain customs or
    individuals, or boost the morale of franchise hirelings.

    As a **Rank 1** decisionist, you gain proficiency with a musical instrument (horn). Head office
    also grants you the use of a musical instrument (your choice of horn), a voting kit (ballots, a
    ballot box, an "I Voted" sticker set), and a coin of decisionry. This large gold coin is
    emblazoned with the sigil of Acquisitions Incorporated as "heads," and has a "tails" image that
    varies.

    +------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

Tiebreaker
    Starting at **Rank 1**, whenever the members of your franchise take a vote, you can present your
    coin of decisionry and cast two votes.

Absentee Ballot
    Starting at **Rank 2**, if a member of your franchise party is absent, you gain their vote and
    can decide quite confidently how they would have voted. In addition, if a vote is ever taken
    while you are absent, you can call for a recount and add your two votes to the final voting
    result.

Coin of Decisionry
    Starting at **Rank 2**, your *coin of decisionry* becomes a common magic item. When you flip the
    coin, it always lands with the Acquisitions Incorporated sigil face down, and a message appears
    on the "tails" face. Roll a d4 on the following table to determine the message.

    +----+---------------+
    | d4 | Decision      |
    +====+===============+
    | 1  | Lucrative     |
    +----+---------------+
    | 2  | Brand Appeal  |
    +----+---------------+
    | 3  | Indeterminate |
    +----+---------------+
    | 4  | Ruinous       |
    +----+---------------+

    The coin has absolutely no divination abilities, and its results when you use it are random. But
    nobody else knows that. When a creature within 10 feet of you flips the coin (after having had
    its powerful prognostication powers dutifully explained), you can exert your will to control its
    operation as a bonus action, choosing the result that appears after it lands as a means of
    gently coercing the user toward a specific course of action. The creature flipping the coin can
    detect your manipulation with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (insight) check.

Better Odds
    When you reach **Rank 3**, your *coin of decisionry* gains a measure of actual divination power
    and becomes an uncommon magic item and becomes an uncommon magic item. In addition to its normal
    function, you can use an action to flip the *coin of decisionry* twice while pondering a
    specific plan or objective, noting both random results. If you succeed a DC 15 Intelligence
    (Arcana) check, you learn which of the two results is more applicable to the course of action.
    This property of the coin can't be used again until the next dawn.

Inspired Decision
    Starting at **Rank 3**, whenever a serious franchise vote is taken and the result goes the way
    you voted, you can inspire the rest of the franchise team with a brief speech. Make a DC 15
    Charisma (Perception) check. On a success, each franchise member of your choice who can hear you
    gains advantage on the next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make in the next
    hour. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Charming Misdemeanor
    As a **Rank 4** decisionist, you can present your *coin of decisionry* to grant yourself an
    extra vote when your franchise votes, for a total of three votes. Once you do so, you cannot do
    so again until dawn seven days later.

Clandestine Kit
    As a **Rank 4**, your voting kit becomes a common magic item that conceals an extradimensional
    space. As a bonus action, you can place one tool kit that you are proficient with into the
    *voting kit*, or can remove it. No other type of object can be placed into the extradimensional
    space. A creature searching the *voting kit* finds an extracts the tool kit with a successful DC
    20 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check.

    Additionally, you can use the *voting kit* to cast *charm person* (save DC 15). This property of
    the kit can't be used again until next dawn.

Documancer
==========

    Every great Acquisitions Incorporated quest begins with a contract from Head Office -- and a
    franchise's documancer is most likely the one who controls and channels the power of that contract.
    A documancer bears the responsibility of managing each of a franchise's quests, of ensuring that
    every condition of the quest is fulfilled, and of recording and sending on information vital to Head
    Office when the mission is complete. When creating contracts with other organizations, a documancer
    makes sure that the language benefits both the franchise and Acquisitions Incorporated.

    As a documancer you are respected for having the commitment and mental fortitude required to
    work with Head Office. You advance your franchise by using documancy for communication,
    insisting on recording all details in writing, retaining records, destroying other records, and
    recalling vital information.

    +------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

Gift of Words
    At **Rank 1**, you are fluent in the semi-arcane language of documancy. This knowledge grants
    you advantage on Intelligence checks to decipher codes or similar scripts. The DM might also
    provide you with hints whenever you try to solve a puzzle or decipher clues involving writing.

Documancy Satchel
    At **Rank 2**, your documancy satchel becomes a common magic item, allowing you to magically
    send and receive documents to and from Head Office through a special pouch. Your *documancy
    satchel* magically produces pre-written and signature-ready contracts at your request, covering
    most common contractual needs. It also occasionally produces sticky notes printed with useful
    information and inspirational quotes from Head Office.

Fluent in Boss
    Also at **Rank 2**, your documancy training allows you to better process Head Office
    communications, as well as to understand what pleases your superiors. You can cast the *augery*
    spell, with the spell's omens of weal or woe, based solely on the perspectives of Head Office.
    (It should be noted that Head Office at times as a surprisingly high disregard for potential woe
    to its employees.) Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until dawn seven days
    later.

Satchel of Holding
    At **Rank 3**, your *documancy satche* gains additional features and becomes an uncommon magic
    item. One of the satchels' pouches now functions as a *bag of holding*. 

    Additionally, you can use an action to draw forth from the documancy satchel *a spell scroll of
    comprehend languages*. The scroll vanishes when used, or ten minutes after it appears. This
    property of the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

Document Flexibility
    Also at **Rank 3**, you gain proficiency with a forgery kit. One such kit (containing several
    types of ink, a variety of parchments and papers, several quills, seals and sealing wax, gold
    and silver leaf, and small tools to sculpt melted wax to mimic a seal) is always contained
    within the extradimensional space of your *documancy satchel*.

Scroll of Humidor
    At **Rank 4**, your *documancy satchel* gains additional power and becomes a rare magic item.
    Within the satchel, a dedicated extradimensional space can hold up to thirty documents or spell
    scrolls. Placing a single document into the scroll humidor is an action. Drawing forth a desired
    scroll is a bonus action.

Scroll Service
    Also at **Rank 4**, you can use an action to request one spell scroll containing a spell up to
    3rd level from Head Office. If you succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, the scroll
    instantly appears within your *documancy satchel*. Only you can use this scroll. The scroll
    vanishes when used, or ten minutes after it has been summoned. After a successful use, this
    property can't be used again until the next dawn.

    used and treasure gained during an adventure. Hoardspersons pay particular attention to making

    whenever possible, and ensuring that the proper selection of loot is sent to Head Office at the
    end of a mission.

    The *living loot satchel* is a kind of magical being that safeguards the franchise's funds nd
    valuables. It's innards are connected to a secure coffer within Head Office's vault in
    `Deepfathom <../notable_cities/deepfathom.html>`__, to which the satchel periodically transfers 
    the franchise's wealth. As an action, you can transfer any amount of your franchise funds back 
    to your satchel with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

Living the Good Life
    Also at **Rank 2**, Head Office trusts that as long as your needs are met, you have no reason to
    skim any profits. You maintain a wealthy lifestyle at no cost to you.

Secret Satchel
    As a **Rank 3** hoardsperson, your *living loot satchel* gets an upgrade to function as the
    replica chest used for the *Leomund's Secret Chest* spell, becoming a rare magic item. You can
    open the secret chest through your *living loot satchel* to deposit or withdraw items--even
    items that wouldn't normally fit in your satchel, but which fit within the chest. Thanks to Head
    Office striking deals you don't want to know about with extraplanar creatures you really don't
    want to know about, there is no chance for the spell to end.

That Thing You Need
    At **Rank 3**, you can use a bonus action to reach into your *living loot satchel** and make a
    DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a success, you draw forth an item of your choice on
    the Adventuring Gear table in chapter 5 of the *Player's Handbook*. The item must be of a size
    that can fit into your secret chest and be worth no more than 15gp. Once you attempt to draw
    five items from your satchel, you cannot draw forth any more items until the next dawn.

Portable Hole Satchel
    At **Rank 4**, your *living loot satchel* receives another upgrade, becoming a very rare magic
    item. The secret chest addressed by your satchel now has the storage capacity of a *portable
    hole* --6 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep. As before, you can place any appropriately sized
    object into the *portable-hole*-sized chest, even if it wouldn't normally fit into your satchel.

That Expensive Thing You Need
    Also at **Rank 4**, when you use your That Thing you Need feature, you can requisition any item
    of up to 250gp in value, as long as it would fit into the container of your satchel's *portable
    hole.*

Loremonger
==========
    *I never forget a detail ... though many wish I would* 
        \- Loremonger mantra

    Information has value, and the loremonger is that information's keeper. A franchise's loremonger studies
    and records all lore relevant to its operation, including tracking the economic, technical, and arcane 
    methods by which the franchise can be improved. A loremonger records the deeds and history of
    the franchise, including the names of places visited and people met during missions. Those
    records are then sent to Head Office (often through a franchise's documancer) to ensure  brand
    integrity.

    As a loremonger, you are a studious individual, usually with an interest in history or technical
    subjects. you might revel in your role, working as a central figure in your franchise as you use
    your knowledge to promote it. Or you might operate from the shadows, resembling a clever
    spymaster and allowing others to be the franchise's public face. You help advance your franchise
    by discovering secrets, tracking important lore gained during the characters' travels, and
    reporting on competitors' goals and methods.

    an ether-filled jar with a long tap hose. The jar is used to record others' stories and your own
    observations, like a verbal notebook with unlimited space. The *whisper jar* records as fast as
    a creature can speak into it, and whispers back words at the same pace they were recorded.

    use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. You can cast this feature
    only once on any creature.

Whispered Encyclopedia
    At **Rank 2**, your *whisper jar* becomes an uncommon magic item that can tap into the broader
    lore of Acquisitions Incorporated. As a bonus action, you ask the jar for information on a
    specific subject and make a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check. On a success, the jar plays back
    a recording on that subject, made somewhere, sometime by another Acq Inc loremonger. This
    property of the *whisper jar* cannot be used again until the next dawn.

Construction Permits
    At **Rank 3**, your knowledge of best practices for improving an Acquisitions Incorporated
    franchise results in a 20% reduction in your franchise's monthly costs.

    above those gained normally through franchise advancement.

Whispered Warnings
    Also at **Rank 3**, your *whisper jar* gains additional power and becomes a rare magic item. As
    an action, you can cause the jar to function as a *wand of enemy detection*, whereupon it
    whispers the directino to foes within range. This property of the *whisper jar* cannot be used
    again until next dawn.

Efficient Upgrades
    At **Rank 4**, your knowledge of franchise lore and development yields further dividends. Your
    franchise headquarters gains one weapon feature and one cosmetic feature over and above those
    gained normally through franchise advancement.

Whispered Arcana
    Also at **Rank 4**, your *whisper jar* gains access to even more magic. By whispering the name
    of one of the following spells into the jar as an action, you can cast that spell from the jar:
    *detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, find traps, identify, or locate
    animals or plants*. This property of the *whisper jar* cannot be used again until the next dawn.

Obviator
========
    *I adjust the odds and remove obstacles to create maximum convenience for our franchise*
        \- Obviator creed

    Obstacles abound along the path to riches. A franchise's mission success might require combating
    a rival organization's disinformation attempts one day, then besting a castle's defenses are
    next. The day after that, some poor sap named Bob might need to be disposed of. And no matter
    what type of challenge that needs to be overcome, the franchise's obviator determines the
    optimal way to shut down and destroy that challenge. (Nothing personal, Bob. It's just
    business).

    As an obviator, you hatch convoluted plans to fight the overwhelming odds presented by each
    mission --by whatever means are necessary. Sometimes you might prefer brute strength over
    improvisation, other times you might undertake a deep study of conflicts and rival
    organizations, working carefully to stay three steps ahead of the opposition. In all cases,
    though, you help advance your franchise by hatching effective plans and tactics, anticipating
    problems, and learning about your foes -- ideally before they can treat you as an obstacle to
    their own success.

Noteworthy Obviators
    Lok

Essential Functions
    Destroy targets (people and information); study conflicts

Position Proficiency
    In addition to the proficiencies listed below, you can add your proficiency bonus to an ability
    check to make sense of an enemy's tactics, discern a hidden threat, or intimidate a foe whose
    weaknesses you have previously assessed (See "Read the Opposition" below).

    As a **Rank 1** obviator, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies.

    Head Office also grants you the use of alchemist's supplies (two glass beakers, a metal frame to
    hold a beaker in place over an open flame, a glass stirring rod, a small mortar and pestle, and
    a poiuch of common alchemical ingredients including salt, powdered iron, and purified water);
    your choice of a vial of acid, a flask of alchemist's fire, or a vial of antitoxin; and a
    hunting trap.

Read the Opposition
    Also at **Rank 1**, you can attempt to get a reading on one creature you can see, trying to
    learn useful information about it. As a bonus action, make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a
    success, you learn three details of your choice about the creature. Once you use this feature,
    you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature only once on any
    creature.

    Possible details you might learn include the creature's goals or motivation, bonds or ideals,
    personality traits, flaws, combat strategy (including common attack methods or tactics),
    financial information, lair location, allies or foes, romantic entanglements, sense of humor, or
    favorite songs.

Alchemist's Insight
    At **Rank 2**, you can use an action to use your alchemist's supplies to identify any unknown
    substance (including alchemical items, potions, and other magical substances). Once you use this
    feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

    | 4  | While lost in the <TODO> Underdark, you were forced to consume mold, fungus, and inspect parts to survive. You developed a taste for that sort of thing.                                  |

    +----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Obviator's Lenses
    Also at **Rank 2**, you gain the use of an uncommon magic item taking the form of a pair of
    spectacles, a spyglass, a monocle, or any other device with one or two lenses. When you look
    through the *obviator's lenses*, you use a bonus action to make them function as *eyes of minute
    seeing* or *eyes of the eagle*. Once you make this choice, it cannot be changed until the next
    dawn.

Advance Preparations
    At **Rank 3**, you gain the ability to declare that you're totally prepared. This preparedness
    takes the form of asking yourself one question, then making a DC 15 Intelligence (History)
    check. On a success, you recall information that could have been uncovered through earlier
    research about your mission. The information can be discreet revelation, a vague hint, or even a
    riddle. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you have finished a long rest.

Travel Alchemical Kit
    Also at **Rank 3**, Head Office provides you with a travel alchemical kit--an uncommon magic
    item containing miniaturized versions of both alchemist's supplies and a poisoner's kit (glass
    vials, a mortar and pestle, chemicals, and a glass stirring rod). You gain proficiency with a
    poisoner's kit as a part of this upgrade.

    You can use this magical kit as long as it is on your person, with no need to draw or stow it.
    If you are ever searched, finding your travel alchemical kit requires a successful DC 20
    Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Insight) check.

Enhanced Lenses
    At **Rank 4**, your *obviator's lenses* gain additional power and become a rare magic item. The
    lenses now function as both *eyes of the eagle* and *eyes of minute seeing*. 

    Additionally, you can focus the power of the lenses to gain accuracy in combat, gaining
    advantage on a weapon attack roll (no action required). If that attack hits, roll one additional
    weapon damage die. This property of the lenses cannot be used again until the next dawn.

Obviate the Opposition
    Also at **Rank 4**, when you use your Read the Opposition feature and fail the check, you still
    learn one detail about the target creature, as chosen by the Dm. Additionally, you can use Read
    the Opposition more than once on the same creature, but if you do so you cannot use this feature
    again on teh same creature until you finish a long rest.

Occultant
=========
    *Our next kill changes everything*
        \- Occultant divination

    An occultant tracks the creatures and foes that a franchise has bested or killed, weighing them
    against the deeds the franchise has achieved. Using the eldritch abacus for which this position
    is named, an occultant measures the karmic coordinates of their franchise, hoping to gain
    portents of that which is yet to come.

    Like all occultants, you are a grim and enigmatic figure. Even your closest companions might be
    wary of the power you channel--and nobody wears that aura of dark mystery like you do. you help
    advance your franchise by determining whether foes should live or die, prognosticating correctly
    (or at least authoritatively), keeping the rest of the party attuned to the importance of karma,
    and making the right calls on how to best "clean up" any incorrect readings or
    misunderstandings.

Noteworthy Occultants
    Talantha Three-Coins

Essential Functions
    Track kills; assess the value of the franchise of the living and the dead

Position Proficiency
    In addition to the proficiencies noted below,you can add your proficiency bonus to an ability
    check to intimidate a creature close to death, assess what disease or poison killed a creature,
    or explain what the dead body is doing under your bed at the inn.

    As a **Rank 1** occultant, you gain proficiency with one of the following of your choice: cook's
    utensils, leatherworker's tools, or weaver's tools

    Head Office also grants you use of a tool kit for your chosen proficiency, a merchant's scale,
    five waterproof belt pouches in which to store creature parts or other tools, and a unique item
    known as the occultant abacus (sometimes just referred to as an occultant), whose beads resemble
    tiny skulls.

Read the Kill
    Also at **Rank 1**, your occultant abacus not only tracks your franchise's kills, it helps you
    determine the impact of those kills on teh franchise's fate. Over a period of 1 minute, you can
    study a creature killed by someone in your franchise within the last 24 hours, then grant the
    character who slew it a d10. Once within the next hour, that character can add teh d10 to an
    attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. If it's not clear who administered the killing
    blow, you grant this benefit to a random creature involved in the fight. Once you use this
    feature you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

    +----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Eldritch Occultant
    Starting at **Rank 2**, your occultant abacus becomes an uncommon magic item that can track
    lives both eliminated and saved. While holding your *occultant abacus* within 5 feet of a
    creature killed within the past 24 hours, you can cast the *augery* spell. The course of action
    you inquire about with the spell does not need to have any connection to the dead creature. This
    property of the *occultant abacus* can't be used again until the next dawn.

Bring Out Your Dead
    Also at **Rank 2**,  you regain the use of your Read the Kill feature after you finish a short
    or long rest.

Bead of Instant Karma
    At **Rank 3**, one of the beads on your *occultant abacus* channels the power of instant karma,
    turning the *occultant abacus* into a rare magic item. As a reaction, you can target one
    creature you can see that is about to attempt an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw,
    either granting advantage or imposing disadvantage on the roll. The bead crumbles to dust when
    used, reappearing on your *occultant abacus* at the next dawn.

Death's Omen
    Also at **Rank 3**, you gain the ability to read the grim portents of a creature's demise. As a
    bonus action, choose a creature you can see that is below its hit point maximum and make a DC 15
    Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, you determine whether this creature's immediate death
    would have a neutral, negative, or positive ramifications for you and your franchise. If the
    ramifications are different for you and the franchise, you learn this as well.

Bead of Diverted Karma
    At **Rank 4**, one of the beads on your *occultant abacus* allows you to divert karma to where
    it's needed, turning the *occultant abacus* into a very rare magic item. While the bead is
    unused, you know automatically when any creature that you can see is about to make an ability
    check, attack roll, or saving throw with disadvantage. When such a roll is made, you can use a
    reaction to grant a d10 to a different creature you can see. That creature can add d10 to any
    ability check, attack roll or saving throw it makes within the next minute. The bead crumbles to
    dust when used, reappearing on your *occultant abacus* at the next dawn.

Correct the Balance
    As a **Rank 4** occultant, you learn that sometimes the death of a creature has unintended
    consequences. Within seven days of a creature's death, you can use your *occultant abacus* to
    divine ways to reverse or mitigate events resulting from that death. As an action, make a DC 15
    Intelligence (Religion) check.  On a success, you learn the relevant information based on the
    nature of the creature and its place in the world.

    If you fail the check, this property of the *occultant abacus* can't be used again until the
    next dawn. If you succeed on the check, this property can't be used again  until seven days
    later.

Secretarian
===========
    *I've sold ice in Icewind Dale.*
        \-Secretarian's boast

    A secretarian's focus is on people--and all the potential value that might be wrung out of them.
    Every person met outside a franchise is a potential customer to a secretarian, who does whatever
    they can to bring the relationship to fulfillment. A secretarian seeks always to promote their
    franchise and gain greater value than they give. They have the skills to negotiate with
    subemployees, temporary hirelings, seasonal staff, and other humanoid (usually) resources. When
    staff members have problems, the secretarian is teh one who patiently listens (or at least
    pretends to) until everything calms down.

    As a secretarian, you are respected for having the fortitude to listen to both customers and
    coworkers without going insane. you help advance your franchise by keeping staff happy (enough),
    hiring competent (enough) workers, coming up with slogans and catchphrases, launching marketing
    schemes, and getting jingles and slogans stuck in customer's heads. And while your superiors
    don't official condone undermining the branding efforts of other organizations, no one can argue
    with the effictiveness of that approach.

Sending Stone
    Also at **Rank 1**, you are given use of an Acquisitions Incorporated *sending stone*, an
    uncommon magic item that resembles a gemstone in a bold setting. It functions like a normal
    *sending stone* except that it has no matching stone and allows communications with Head Office,
    specific secretarians you know, and the secretarian nearest your location. you must succeed on a
    DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to establish contact. Once the stone is successfully, it can't
    be used again until the next dawn.

    Making contact with another secretarian assumes that they are in possession of their own
    *sending stone*.

    +----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 2  | It gets great reception everywhere except in your headquarters                                          |
    +----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 3  | It sometimes picks up other magical conversations                                                       |

    +----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 5  | It heats up when you use it, to the extent that it once burned through your gloves.                     |

    | 6  | It has an obnoxious ringtone that you can't work out how to change                                      |
    +----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    | 8  | It's voice activated, so that every time you talk to someone, it tries to send a message tosomeone else |
    +----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Portfolio Keeper
    At **Rank 2**, you gain the use of a weathered leather pouch that is an uncommon magic item. The
    *portfolio keeper* holds and organizes notes, brochures, and business cards bearing your contact
    information. It also has an inexhaustible scheme.

    When you meet someone for the first time, their details and a rough sketch are magically stored
    on a small parchment card in the *portfolio keeper*. You can access the details of any such
    stored card as a bonus action.

Rumor Mill
    Also at **Rank 2**, whenever your franchise begins a major quest or mission, make a DC 15
    Intelligence (History) check. On a success, you can learn up to three rumors related to
    creatures or organizations involved in the mission, which come to you through your *sending
    stone*. These rumors reflect current or historical knowledge possessed by Acquisitions
    Incorporated or the organization's many contacts.

Cards of Sending
    At **Rank 3**, the power of your *portfolio keeper* becomes more potent, makin git a rare 
    magic item. When you give out a business card stored in your *portfolio keeper* you can 
    choose to have the card allow its recipient to contact you through your *sending stone* as
    if they had a cast a *sending spell*. A business card loses this power seven days after it 
    has been given out no more than 5 cards can have this power at one time.

    You can also use your *sending stone* to cast *sending* and contact anyone who has one of
    your business cards. Once you use this feature of the stone, you cannot use it again until
    dawn of the next day.

Improved Rumor Mill
    At **Rank 3**, when you use your Rumor Mill feature, the DM provides you with a sense of
    which parts of a particular rumor are inaccurate, if any. You do not necessarily learn
    the truth behind those false rumors.

Always Hiring
    At **Rank 4**, you have little trouble finding the right people for the job. As an action, while
    in a populated area, you can make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to locate an NPC who can
    provide a service immediately, no questions asked, for the standard fee. On a successful check,
    information regarding the potential hire comes to you as supernatural insight, word of mouth, an
    advertisement blowing into your face, or a similarly convenient method. Once you use this
    feature you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

    Hirelings acquired through this feature are in addition to any franchise staff. They can be
    invited to bolster existing staff or fill a sudden need, but they are not of the baseline staff
    gained through a franchise's rank. Theyir pay is not covered by the franchise's normal ones.

Headquarter Expansion
*********************

Tavern
======

How it Works
------------

The tavern expansion allows for the accumulation of gold for
‘in-between-session’ adventurers. Every adventure accrues an amount of
gold, a percentage of which is held for adventurers who managed to miss
an episode or two. This provides players who have not always been around
to receive some share of the guild’s profits.

In order to increase the profitability of the tavern inside a guild
hall, improvements must be made to the underlying infrastructure -
better benches, newer taps, more ale selection, etc. These can be
purchased using the following table.

Tavern Gold Eligibility
-----------------------

In order for an adventurer to be eligible for an amount of gold, the
character must have done the following: Participated in at least one (1)
episode with **Hot Mess of Brie**

Gold must exist in the coffers of tavern office

The gold received from the tavern is not split among the returning,
eligible players. Each player receives the same amount of gold.

Example Usage
-----------------------

Khadhar, Eberhard, and Heleana happily return from adventuring and each
scrape out of the adventure earning 1733gp each. This is the party’s
paybill and is used to exactly determine how much gold will be generated
by the Tavern by the next session for returning players. The guild
headquarters has only the first and foremost installment of the tavern
and is able to collect 10% of the adventure’s winnings for returning
players next session.

The party managed to scrape 5200gp from the episode, 300 of which
belongs to Acquisitions Incorporated head office. With the remaining
4900gp, the current percentage of the tavern level can then be used to
calculate the amount of gold for next sessions absentee players.

+------------------------------------+----------+
| Party Gold                         | 5200gp   |
+------------------------------------+----------+
| Acquisitions Incorporated Tax      | 300gp    |
+------------------------------------+----------+
| Net Gold                           | 4900gp   |
+------------------------------------+----------+
| Tavern Earnings Percentage         | 10%      |
+------------------------------------+----------+
| Tavern Earnings for Next Episode   | 490g     |
+------------------------------------+----------+

:Example:    (5200gp - 300gp) \* 0.1 = 490gp next episode for returning players

At the beginning of the next session Magnus returns for another episode
with the gang and receives 490gp.

Inn

How it Works
------------

By adding an second level to your headquarters, you are now able to
house customers overnight as well as offer a full kitchen.

Enchanter/Artificer Booth
=========================

A local enchanter and artificer asks to rent a booth inside your
headquarters in order to bring business to his artificing skills. By
having a place to operate of high notoriety, the enchanter has the
ability to increase the efficacy of his magicks as well as being an
on-call resource for the guild.

How it Works
------------
The enchanter is able to disenchant magical equipment
and returns to the player disenchantment tokens commensurate to the
quality of the item. These tokens can then be exchanged for custom
magical items at the request of the player.

Requesting an Artifact
----------------------

The enchanter is only able to create items with an accurate description
of the request. If the player wanted to add an enchantment to an item,
it may take a varying amount of time and the item must be left with the
enchanter to be worked on.

Requesting new artifacts is as simple as leaving an item to enchant with
a description of the desired effect. Once the enchanter and the player
come to terms, the cost is negotiated and the enchanter will start work
right away.
