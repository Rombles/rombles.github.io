Adventurers

Bolson Longlake
***************

Dragonborn Paladin.

Guild Position: *Unknown*

Feature: Researcher
===================

When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know 
where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, 
or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted 
away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of 
the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

Notable Achievements
====================

- Bolson doesn't know what it's like to back down. When the party was engaged in an all-out battle with a wraith
  in the crypts of
  `Castle Rend </docs/other_locations.html#castle-rend>`__
  , Bolson immediately shackled the wraith and went toe-to-toe until one of them died!

Gustavo Pompodorious
********************

Half-elf Bard, College of Glamour

Gustavo is a very self-involved character. Having grown up rich with nothing better to do, Gustavo spent most of
his time reading dime novels about an over-glorified adventurer. Once he finished reading them all (over a dozen
times, at least), he decided to become an adventurer himself.

Halaena Enrona and Charlie
**************************

Halaena is a wood elf ranger (hunter) with a `mastiff pet.  <adventurers.html#charlie>`__

The last remaining member of her tribe, Halaena is the epitome of the
rugged individualist. She knows better than to ascribe qualities such as
mercy or bounty to the forests of her youth. There are a thousand ways
to die in the wilderness, and she has survived through muscle, wits, and
will.

Halaena grew up in the wilds, far from civilization and the comforts of
town and technology. The wild is in her blood. Even in places where she
doesn't know the specific features of the terrain, she knows the way of
the wild. She has an excellent memory for maps and geography, and can
always recall the general layout of terrain, settlements, and other
features around her. In addition, she can find food and fresh water for
herself and up to five other people each day, provided that the land
offers berries, small game, water, and so forth.

Guild Position: `Cartographer </docs/appendix_a/cartographer.html>`__

Charlie
=======

Charlie was found by himself outside of 
`The Babbling Bandit <notable_cities.html#the-babbling-bandit>`__
in 
`Kassoon. <notable_cities/kassoon.html>`__
After searching for the rightful owner, he happily followed Halaena home
and has been her sidekick ever since.

Charlie seems to possess an extremely high intelligence, able to
formulate complex plans and understand instructions. He is a capable
fighter and a fast runner, and in combat will occasionally emit a nimbus
of pale blue light. His bark is capable of breaking people out of an
enchanted sleep, and spur them to action. He also seems to possess an
endurance and healing ability far beyond mortal dogs; a few hours after
being hit by a large bull, he can fight with the Adventurers with
relative ease.

Charlie is suspected to be a Foo Dog - mostly sentinels, they keep an
eye for dark spirits or dark energy, guard the people or places they're
supposed to and alert to dangers present. They are intelligent, very
loyal, tough, and can seriously kick ass. They are not bulletproof and
can be killed like anything else.

Charlie has an innate ability to detect evil should the party pay
attention to his reactions. He has been known to stop undead in their
tracks solely by barking.
