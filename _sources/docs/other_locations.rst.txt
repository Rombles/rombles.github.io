Havel’s Crossing
****************

Large tavern/stable/inn as a rest stop location for large carriage
passways. Was ransacked by `Calador <appendix_b.html#calador>`__ and the rest of his ghoulish party
after being overcome by `The Bone of Doresain. <items.html#the-bone-of-doresain>`__

The Fantasy Costco
******************

The largest emporium of magic items, The Fantasy Costco is the one-stop
shop for all adventurers that have a membership.

The Ouroboros Temple (Original)
*******************************

Source location of The Ouroboros Cult. It was here that Calador found
The Bone of Doresain and was overcome by its inherent evil energy.

The Ouroboros Temple (Headquarters)
***********************************

Headquarters to the Acquisitions Incorporated guild Hot Mess of Brie.
Was once the temple of a doomsday cult, but was moved by magical means
by Jim Darkmagic to the city of Kasoon in the Principality of Mingia.

Oddly, there is a magical quirk in this building that causes each
staircase to appear to have exactly one more step either going up or
down the stairs.

Kernwith Keep
*************

Home of the Flaming Fist Mercenary camp

The Tombs of the Menhirs
************************

Dangerous tombs of gaudy, greedy kings.

The Menhirs were once powerful bloodlines imbued with powerful magicks.
As they rose above the Men of the time, so did their willingness to do
whatever they could to sate their greed. Eventually this lead to their
downfall, causing them to rot in their graves with powerful protectors
to keep their wealth with them.

**Gimish Cogsnoggin** knows tons of information about this tomb site,
but he just needs some prodding.

The Tomb of the Dawn Prince
===========================


It is in this tomb that the Adventurers met a nest of stirges and one
angry Carrion Crawler, hell-bent on snapping Eberhard and Charlie the
Mastiff’s limbs.

The Tomb of the Meridian Lord
=============================


It was here the party rescued Baroness Persephone Ashbridge from the
clutches of a ruthless poltergeist. Had Kadar not purchased the Wormwood
Petals, the party may have been toast!

The Tomb of the Princess of Dusk
================================

It was here in this tomb that the adventurer’s encountered Wights and
dangerous illusion magic - during which Eberhard found himself dancing
with rats. In addition to these perils, the characters were introduced
to the religion of The Idiot God.

The Tomb of the King of Midnight
================================

Here the adventurers met all kinds of gross nasties - Gelatinous Ooze,
Mimics, and even a Frat Spectator. The gang recovered all kinds of fat
treasure and even managed to take some home.
