The Bone of Doresain
********************

Recovered from the ruins surrounding The Ouroboros Temple (Original).
This effigy was once the recipient of a great deal of dark magic worship
from long-dead Ouroboros Cult.

The Longsword of Greatest Reach
*******************************

Sold at The Mareâ€™s Whinney. 9 foot long Greatsword with incredible
balance that costs an inordinate amount of gold. Very much the envy of
one Eberhard who cannot wait to get his hands on it.

Ring of Frost

A ring rumoured to make you invisible.
