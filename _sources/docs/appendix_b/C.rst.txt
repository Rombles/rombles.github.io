Calador
~~~~~~~

Once a treasure-hunting High Elf, Calador is the head administrator of
the guild of Hot Mess of Brie. He performs the day-to-day tasks managing
the day-to-day operations of the guild headquarters as well as any
administrative task requiring the cooperation of the guild with the
headquarters of Acquisitions Incorporated. 

Personal Life
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Calador went to wizarding school in an attempt to gain favor from his
family, much like his oldest brother `Faen. <F.html#grand-vizer-faen>`__

Adventurerâ€™s Backstory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Calador found The Bone of Dorsain - a legendary magical artifact used to
worship the Ouroboros Snake in the cult temple of life, death, and
rebirth The Ouroboros Temple. He met the adventuring party when Winsom
Landy hired the adventurers to help escort a magical artifact back to
civilization for identification and eventual resell.

`The Bone of Doresain, </docs/items.html#the-bone-of-doresain>`__ however, was full of incredibly potent necrotic
energy and eventually drove Calador mad, causing him to crave humanoid
flesh. Throughout the adventure her turned all of his compatriots into
ghouls under his control.

After being defeated by The Hot Mess of Brie team, he was brought back
from the beyond as a spectre by `Jim Darkmagic <J.html#jim-darkmagic>`__ (as a kind of cruel joke
or otherwise) to perform as the Guild Administrator for The Hot Mess of
Brie.

He is not well known to do his administrative duties effectively. He
also refers to all those living inside `The Ouroboros Temple
(Headquarters) </docs/other_locations.html#the-ouroboros-temple-original>`__ as trespassers.
