Jacob Ashbridge, Baron
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A garish baron with an exceedingly large plantation on the outskirts of
`Kassoon. </docs/notable_cities/kassoon.html>`__ Recently he’s decided to spend his fortune ensuring that he and
his wife `Persephone Ashbridge <P.html#persephone-ashbridge-baroness>`__ live throughout eternity resting in wild
and difficult locations. Having sought out `The Tomb of the Meridian Lord, </docs/other_locations.html#the-tomb-of-the-meridian-lord>`__ 
he and his wife `Persephone <P.html#persephone-ashbridge-baroness>`__ have bitten off more than they can chew
when a deadly poltergeist and a devious carrion crawler halt construction.

After the Adventurers successfully returned `Persephone Ashbridge <P.html#persephone-ashbridge-baroness>`__ to him,
he told the players that he’s always got work for reliable employees.

Jeremy Snoot
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most easily intimidated customs official in the city of `Kassoon </docs/notable_cities/kassoon.html>`__,
From blueprints of government buildings to shipping manifests, he’s your
halfling.

Very timid, somewhat like Porky Pig if Porky pig had no backbone.

Jim Darkmagic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Have a magical day!

Jim Winifred Darkmagic III is the scion of a mysterious, multiplanar
wizarding family. Jim’s arcane pedigree has long preceded him,
incorporating equally healthy amounts of magical training and innate
eldritch prowess. However, despite a natural talent that could have
allowed him to make a name for himself as a court wizard, or perhaps
“that strange old man in the village,” Jim’s original penchant was not
for the magic of scroll or spell, but for the stage.

As an entertainer and purveyor of the “Jim Darkmagic Experience,” the
legendary mage can often be found in markets and town squares,
performing features of mundane legerdemain. The renown he has earned for
these feats is nearly equaled by the reputation that follows him as
chief arcanist (and occasional arsonist) for Acquisitions Incorporated.
And although his skills as an adventurer and real wizard remain highly
sought after, Jim looks forward to a well-earned retirement, at which
point he hopes to become a “real wizard” -- by which he means a fake
wizard -- full time.

Jim Darkmagic (High Elf) is the owner/CEO of the Acquisitions
Incorporated (AI) company, which franchised Hot Mess of Brie out of the
city of Kasoon

Not much is known about Jim Darkmagic other than he is a very powerful
wizard, known for using the magic at-will to momentarily inconvenience
other during regular conversations. Additionally Darkmagic has been
known to perform powerful ritualistic magic. In the beginning of the
Incorporation of Hot Mess of Brie, he and a few other mages teleported
the entire Ouroboros Temple to the city of `Kassoon </docs/notable_cities/kassoon.html>`__ to make it more
readily accessible to a town.

Jim Darkmagic publicly resents the influence that `The Grand Vizer Faen <F.html#grand-vizer-faen>`__
has on all local politics (and thus AI)

Jolruzai Runzehr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overseer of plant sales and assassinations merchant lord in `Kassoon. </docs/notable_cities/kassoon.html>`__

Informed by `Kirnih Oceantalon <K.html#kirnih-oceantalon>`__, 
owner of `A Florist’s Delight, </docs/notable_cities.html#a-florists-delight>`__ 
that `Boxwood Clovers </docs/notable_cities.html#boxwood-clovers>`__ was a new, 
unregulated business on the scene. In response, she
tightened import regulations and sent agents undercover to threaten
`Tifter <T.html#tifter-and-tiffany-valeure>`__ into submitting 
to her commercial control. When nothing changed,
it was `Zhanti <Z.html#zhanti>`__ who convinced her to do nothing. In exchange for tax-free
armour for her assassins, Jolruzai would no longer interfere with `Boxwood Clovers. </docs/notable_cities.html#boxwood-clovers>`__

Jolruzai grew more frustrated that a new business (that she didn’t
control) was hoarding a big proportion of the plant market’s money. With
a little persuasion from the local stall holders, she granted `Kirnih <K.html#kirnih-oceantalon>`__
a sanction to kill `Tifter <T.html#tifter-and-tiffany-valeure>`__ 
by poison, her specialty. `Kirnih's <K.html#kirnih-oceantalon>`__ 
poison, however, only sent `Tifter <T.html#tifter-and-tiffany-valeure>`__ to sleep.
