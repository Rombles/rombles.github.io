Tifter and Tiffany Valeure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tifter and Tiffany were born to middle class human parents Hortiff and
Yasmina Valeure, two mercenaries stationed in the city of Waterdeep. The
jobs paid well, and so the two children never wanted for anything. It
had always been a family tradition that when a child comes of age (18),
they must flee the nest to train at another mercenary encampment,
believing that a new “cultural experience” is good for the soul.

Tifter was never a good soldier – he was too busy jumping on the newest
bandwagon for personal glory to worry about the “greater good”. However,
to ensure a good allowance was maintained from his parents, he agreed to
travel to the Flaming Fist Camp in `Kernwith Keep <../other_locations.html#kernwith-keep>`__ 
to “really make a difference to the impoverished peninsula”. Tifter never made it to
`Kernwith Keep, <../other_locations.html#kernwith-keep>`__ instead enamoured 
by the commerce and excitement of `Kassoon. <../notable_cities.html#kassoon>`__ 
He decided to open a flower shop selling Boxwood Clovers. The clovers were
a hit with the locals, quickly becoming known for its beautiful scent and 
unique colourings. Tifter set up shop in the `Kassoon. <../notable_cities.html#kassoon>`__
town center the place to be if you were going to sell anything.  

Tifter met `Kris Dicant, <K.html#krissa-dicant>`__ a traveller “looking for work”. Their
relationship quickly spiralled from there. First lovers and then
friends, the pair ended up becoming business partners for the successful
shop, now named `Boxwood Clovers. <../notable_cities.html#boxwood-clovers>`__ 
As Tifter’s luck would have it, `Kris <K.html#krissa-dicant>`__ is
in fact a member of 
`Daermon N'a'shezbaernon, <../religions_and_organizations.html#daermon-n-a-shezbaernon>`__  
an underground spy network seeking wealth wherever they can. `Kris, <K.html#krissa-dicant>`__ 
themself is part of the search for the `Ring of Frost, <../items.html#ring-of-frost>`__ 
a magical item rumoured to render someone invincible. When they realised the 
search was fruitless, they decided to park the endeavour for a bit to focus on 
something more interesting – money. `Boxwood Clovers. <../notable_cities.html#boxwood-clovers>`__ 
had unfortunately had a few robberies in recent months, and Tifter had been followed 
home on a number of occasions by people trying to find out where the stash 
of flowers was stored. 

Eventually it was decided that the shop needed protection – `Kris <K.html#krissa-dicant>`__ 
quickly provided 9 guards for the work.
