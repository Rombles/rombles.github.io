Zhanti
~~~~~~

Merchant lord. Overseer of armour sales and a member of both the secret
`Ytepka Society <../religions_and_organizations.html#ytepka-society>`__ and 
`Daermon N'a'shezbaernon, <../religions_and_organizations.html#daermon-n-a-shezbaernon>`__
in `Kassoon. <../notable_cities.html#kassoon>`__

Principal motivation as a merchant lord after money is restoring moral
order through the peninsula’s secret 
`Ytepka Society. <../religions_and_organizations.html#ytepka-society>`__ 
She’s one of the society’s contacts with 
`Daermon N'a'shezbaernon, <../religions_and_organizations.html#daermon-n-a-shezbaernon>`__ 
and has thus been working with `Kris Dicant <K.html#krissa-dicant>`__ to 
establish trust before weeding her way in further.

Zhanti protected `Boxwood Clovers <../notable_cities.html#boxwood-clovers>`__ 
from `Jolruzai <J.html#jolruzai-runzehr>`__ by offering a favorable
trade in exchange for no longer looking to extract money from the
business. Zhanti had found the taste for money again and began to demand
a percentage of profits from the business. While `Kris <K.html#krissa-dicant>`__ 
remained strong at first, their resolve weakened and they began to feel the pressure to
earn more money.
