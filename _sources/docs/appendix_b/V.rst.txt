Viziel Kresk
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mad calligrapher, scribe to the ninth caliphate, and imperial steward of
thaumaturgic diagrams. Dabbled in forbidden scriptomancy while parlaying with
wizards of the Outerworlds. his error-riddled translations often resulted in
toxic texts and sumbols. Unfortunately, he was a prolific transcriber and loose
sheets of his work pollute more reputable efforts - either by mistake or with
malicious purpose to punish unauthorized readers.

His ourvre turned out to be booby-trapped - once it was opened by an
unsuspecting librarian at 
`The Wizard's Sleeve </docs/notable_cities.html#the-wizards-sleeve>`__, all the
sheets of paper flitted out of the book and placed themselves in other, more
rudimentary books causing them to be possessed by dark magicks. Thankfully 
`Hot Mess of Brie </docs/franchises.html#hot-mess-of-brie>`__ was on the scene
and was able to help defeat the cursed magic animating all the tomes and scrolls
in the library. However, Viziel Kresk's spectre managed to escape.
