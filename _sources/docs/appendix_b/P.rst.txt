Paulson Oakenthane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Daronith's <D.html#daronith-oakenthane>`__ brother died in 
`Deepfathom Mines </docs/notable_cities/deepfathom.html#deepfathom-mines>`__
two months earlier, when an accident caused the mine's drilling rig to crash
down and seal the entrance shaft. His body was never found, and unknown to
anyone else, that months long exposure to voidwater has caused him to rise as a
ghast that now lurks in the caverns of the mine.

Perry is the primary and lead documancer for the Hot Mess of Brie team.
He is a very shrewd gnome who does his best to make predatory contracts
in favor of the guild.

Persephone Ashbridge, Baroness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wife of `Baron Jacob Ashbridge, <J.html#jacob-ashbridge-baron>`__ 
Persephone is a shrewd and wicked woman.  She is a thoroughly distasteful 
woman interested only in her greed and momentary whims.

After a harrowing attempt to clear out 
`The Tomb of the Meridian Lord </docs/other_locations.html#the-tomb-of-the-meridian-lord>`__ 
for her own burial site, she was rescued by the Hot Mess of Brie adventurers
and returned safely to her husband. She now appreciates what they have
to offer skill-wise, if only barely.
