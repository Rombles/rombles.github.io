Paulson Oakenthane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Daronith's <D.html#daronith-oakenthane>`__ brother died in 
`Deepfathom Mines </docs/notable_cities/deepfathom.html#deepfathom-mines>`__
two months earlier, when an accident caused the mine's drilling rig to crash
down and seal the entrance shaft. His body was never found, and unknown to
anyone else, that months long exposure to voidwater has caused him to rise as a
ghast that now lurks in the caverns of the mine.

The Dreadlord Pelliton
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The despodic will of
`Lord Saxton <S.html#lord-saxton>`__
is made manifest by Pelliton. Pelliton is despised by the people of
`Bedegar <other_locations.html#barony-of-bedegar>`__ 
, and for good reason. The Dreadlord is an authoritarian strongman who hides his true cowardice behind a smoke
screen of noble status and power of his superior, Lord Saxton. He also possesses unholy powers thanks to a 
supernatural bargain he forged with a dark spirit. He is known in 
`Gravesford <notable_cities/gravesford.html>`__
as a petty tyrant who's used to taking what he wants, daring anyone to defy him.

Pelliton takes great pleasure in making other people fear and hate him, and whenever someone lashes out in anger,
he strikes them down with sadistic glee. He rarely kills his victims, instead preferring to leave them covered
in scars and just alive enough to grow his legendary infamy.

Pelliton is tall and thin, but muscular, with an imposing suit of armor. His skin is distressingly pale and his shining
shaved head and pitch-black goatee can be spotted from a mile off on a clear day.

----

    *Sir Pelliton makes himself feel powerful by making others suffer. He also wants to curry Lord Saxton’s favor 
    to ensure himself higher station and greater rewards in Saxton’s regime.*

    *Dreadlord Pelliton holds a dark secret regarding his bargaining.
    Will the players be able to figure it out?*

Perry is the primary and lead documancer for the Hot Mess of Brie team.
He is a very shrewd gnome who does his best to make predatory contracts
in favor of the guild.

Persephone Ashbridge, Baroness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wife of `Baron Jacob Ashbridge, <J.html#jacob-ashbridge-baron>`__ 
Persephone is a shrewd and wicked woman.  She is a thoroughly distasteful 
woman interested only in her greed and momentary whims.

After a harrowing attempt to clear out 
`The Tomb of the Meridian Lord </docs/other_locations.html#the-tomb-of-the-meridian-lord>`__ 
for her own burial site, she was rescued by the Hot Mess of Brie adventurers
and returned safely to her husband. She now appreciates what they have
to offer skill-wise, if only barely.

Pinna Grayfall
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pinna is a young wizard who lives in the village of 
`Gravesford </docs/notable_cities/gravesford.html>`__
, at the edge of the 
`The Forest Rend </docs/other_locations.html#the-forest-rend>`__
. She is easily recognizable by her tall, pointed straw hat, curly red hair, and crystal necklace—her arcane focus. 
Pinna is a country hedge mage, well respected by the people of Gravesford. 

Pinna is a clever woman and one of the few literate people in town — but she feels the need to hide her dark past, preferring to keep her magic light and her potions healthy and helpful.
In another life, Pinna worked as the head researcher under
`Halimath Ilphelkiir </docs/appendix_b/H.html#halimath-ilphelkiir>`__
working to understand the deep, dark magicks left behind by
`Incabulos </docs/gods/incabulos.html>`__.
After a close encounter with some of the darker creatures fueled by this magic, Pinna hung up her at and moved
to Gravesford to use her talents in a more efficacious way for the betterment of the life of those that live there.

Sadly, the
`Shards of Incabulos </docs/items.html#the-shards-of-incabulos>`__
have begun to come back into power after laying dormant for some time and she has been called upon once again
to help put the crisis to bed.

----

    *Pinna wants to be forget about her times spent with Halimath. She loves the village folk, 
    but they are overawed by any little display of magic.*
