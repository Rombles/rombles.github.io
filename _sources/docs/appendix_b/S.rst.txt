Lord Saxton
~~~~~~~~~~~

Saxton is a power-hungry lord mashall and regent of Bedegar. He actively makes life difficult for
those in the Barony. He is well-obeyed, generally despised, and rather dispicable.

Shortly before the players became involved in the local politics of the
`Barony of Bedegar <other_locations.html#barony-of-bedegar>`__ 
, Saxton conspired with
`Blood Chieftain Dorokor </docs/appendix_b/D.html#blood-chieftain-dorokor>`__
to kill the
`Baron of Bedegar <B.html#lord-bedegar>`__ 
and his family. In return, Dorokor would receive an ancient orc talisman, kept
by the Bedegar family as a trophy in their crypts.

With the Bedegars dead, Saxton was free to sit on the throne in
`Bedegar Keep </docs/other_locations.html#bedegar-keep>`__
where he is free to impose his tyrannical (and human-supremacist) will upon the 
people. The common folk of Bedegar are ambivalent to Saxton, but they revile his elite
servant, the sadistic
`Dreadlord Pelliton </docs/appendix_b/P.html#the-dreadlord-pelliton>`__.

One of Saxton's first acts as regent was to double-cross his orcish pawns. When Dorokor
sent a scout to claim the promised artifact, Saxton killed the orc emissary and sent his
knights across the countryside, nailing death warrants for Bonebreaker Dorokor and her
`White Tusk Orcs </docs/religions_and_organizations.html#white-tusk-orcs>`__
in every tavern in every village they came across.

Surina Kraghead
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Surina is the widow of Dormeck Kraghead, the most recent victim of the mine.
Dormeck died mysteriously on a routine dig shortly after the mine was reopened,
and was found pinned to the ceiling and incinerated

    *The characters must discover that Dormeck was killed by the dark magic
    bestowed upon the undead Pauslon Oakenthane by long-term exposure to
    voidwater, and to deliver the justice Surina demands for her husband's
    death.*
