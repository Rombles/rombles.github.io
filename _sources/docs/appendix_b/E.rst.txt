Edmund Bedegar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Son of `Lord Bedegar <B.html#lord-bedegar>`__.

Edmund Bedegar is thirteen years old and the last of the Bedegar line. He is small and his voice is still 
cracking and peaking, but a perceptive person can see in his eyes the steely resolve of a confident ruler.

Edmund’s older brother was to be the next baron, but as is traditional Edmund trained next to his brother in 
all things. He learned falconry, jousting, how to host a dinner, the proper ways to address a duke, a king, 
a count, or another baron. He idolized his older brother and expected to serve as his squire this next year, and 
then become chancellor of his court once his brother ascended to the barony. That was before

came.

Now, Edmund is the rightful Baron of 
`Bedegar <other_locations.html#barony-of-bedegar>`__ 
by birthright, and he knows it. This is a tragedy, something he never wanted. And though he cries at night 
for his dead family, he staves off despair by focusing on his commitment to upholding the family name, and 
becoming the leader he knows his family would want. He intends to honor his father and brother, his mother 
and sisters, by ruling where they cannot. This is the steel inside young Edmund.

He knows his station and expects to be treated with the respect his title deserves, but he is not a petulant 
child. He is a young lord with a kind heart and an ingrained sense of justice. He rightfully fears the orcs 
that kidnapped him, every night remembering his family dying under their axes.

He continually reminds himself, I am Baron now, what would my father do? The health of the barony must come 
first. And Dorokor would make as powerful an ally as she has been an enemy. He wants revenge, but not as much 
as he wants to be the kind of savvy ruler his father was. When he discovers that his father’s friend, 
`Lord Saxton <S.html#lord-saxton>`__
, is the architect of the night his family died, he may set his hatred of the orcs aside and turn his ire upon 
the true mastermind.

Throughout his tenure with the White Tusk, he forged a special bond and knowing respect with 
`Blood Chieftain Dorokor </docs/appendix_b/D.html#blood-chieftain-dorokor>`__
. Although their time together was brief, she taught him that might isn't always the best way to rule and that
even the mighty have to think about their actions if they want to maintain the respect of those that serve.

    *Edmund wants to avenge the death of his family by executing their murderer. At the start of this adventure, 
    he believes this to be Bonebreaker Dorokor, but his ire could be turned to Lord Saxton if the truth were 
    revealed to him. He also wants to return to Bedegar Keep so that he may give his family a proper funeral.*
