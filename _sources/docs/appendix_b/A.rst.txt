Aleith Skyborn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A young and charismatic priest of
`The Church of the High Sun </docs/notable_cities/deepfathom.html#the-church-of-the-high-sun>`__.
Aleith leads a fervent and rapidly growing congregation composed mostly of mine
workers and their families. He is baby-faced, looking a little more than a
teenager with his piercing dark eyes and a small smile always on his lips. He
tries to convince the characters that some evil power dwells in the mine, and is
both the source of the recent deaths and the force drawing cultists to the
area.

    *Characters need to discover that Aleith is right about both those
    things--because he's the one seeking to control that evil power. In the end,
    his goal is to shut down the mine so that he can claim the site for the
    Cult of the Black Sun.*

----

Head Priest of 
`The Church of the High Sun </docs/notable_cities/deepfathom.html#the-church-of-the-high-sun>`__
that is hell-bent on shutting down the 
`Deepfathom Mines </docs/notable_cities/deepfathom.html#deepfathom-mines>`__.

It is revealed throughout the episode that Aleith is actually a priest of
`The Cult of the Black Sun </docs/religions_and_organizations.html#the-cult-of-the-black-sun>`__,
using 
`The Church of the High Sun </docs/notable_cities/deepfathom.html#the-church-of-the-high-sun>`__
as a front for the cult's activities and to seek out those who seek the futility
of worshipping the light. He leads his cultists from an ancient, massive
cathedral to the Black Sun, buried beneath the site of his much more humble
church.

Angus Westwood
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recently decesed King of
`The Principality of Mingia. </docs/world.html#the-principality-of-mingia>`__

The circumstances surrounding his death were suspicious, but no one is able or
willing to investigate the sitting prince 
`Fergus Westwood. <F.html#fergus-westwood>`__ for reasons that are 
obvious to anyone who has ever seen the boy.
