Daronith Oakenthane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A wealthy miner, Daronith discovered the voidwater mine
while digging for gold. Experienced in deep-shaft mining, she
oversaw the construction of the complex machinery that punches down into a large
underground hcamber, opening up new caverns where pools of voidwater flow
freely. Daronith is a middle-aged woman with silvery black hair and a rough
complexion. She is highly ambitious and is eager to return the mine to
operation.
