Located some eighty miles from Kassoon, the mining operation town known as
Deepfathom has brought both tremendous profit and tremendous danger to

Deepfathom Mines
================

Owner: `Daronith Oakenthane </docs/appendix_b/D.html#daronith-oakenthane>`__



The Deepfathom Mine is the only known source of a mysterious reagent known as
voidwater, which commands a high price from alchemists all across the land. But
though accidents have always been a problem at the mine, a rash of recent deaths
have seen miners burned alive or torn apart by unknown creatures -- and are
coming on the heels of appearance of violent cultists in the small community that
serves the mine.

Accidents
---------

* Dormeck Kraghead, Deepwater Mine's lead digger, was mysteriously incinerated
  during an overtime shift in order to make deadlines.
* Day crews have found over thirty miners have been found torn to shreds that
  worked the night crews.

Controversy
-----------

`Daronith Oakenthane </docs/appendix_b/D.html#daronith-oakenthane>`__ has taken a
lot of grief from local towns and officials due to her unwillingness to stop
mining to clear the mine of unknown monsters. Instead of hiring additional
guards to help protect the miners from the dangers, 
`Daronith </docs/appendix_b/D.html#daronith-oakenthane>`__ instead
started paying "danger wages" to entice workers to ignore the dangers and
instead pay attention to their own greed.

`The Church of the High Sun </docs/religions_and_organizations.html#the-church-of-the-high-sun>`__
has caused some issues for the Deepfathom Mine, denouncing it as a place of
evil and the source of dark power. This caused tensions to run high in the 
city when miners began converting to the faith in droves after the accidents
at the mine started. After the mine was no longer able to sustain itself due 
to lack of workers, a large brass cap was constructed and placed over the top 
of the mine to seal away the unknown threats in its depths.

Notable Locations
=================

The Church of the High Sun
--------------------------

High Priest: `Aleith Skyborn </docs/appendix_b/A.html#aleith-skyborn>`__, Male Dwarf

Description: A small temple created from large works of stone that have been
thoroughly worn down by the elements. The form and function of this building is
quite stark - nothing adorns the outside of this building but bright, burning
torches in braziers of stone at every corner.


Falling Rod Tavern
------------------

Owner: `Gendra Jade </docs/appendix_b/G.html#gendra-jade>`__, Female Dwarf

Location: Center of Deepfathom

Description: Seedy rough tavern, massive cracked iron rod, rickety upper
balcony.

    *The raucous noise of this mining tavern's regular crowd fills its rickety
    two-story interior. Miners peer over clay cups of thick beer to assess any
    strangers who enter the establishment. A uge iron rod runs from floor to
    ceiling in the center of the tavern, a deep crack splitting it halfway from
    the bottom. The second-story balcony leans precariously over the lower
    floor, its bent timbers held up with splintered wooden posts.*
