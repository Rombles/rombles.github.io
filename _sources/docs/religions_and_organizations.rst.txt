The Cult of the Black Sun
**************************

A nasty little cult run by 
`Aleith Skyborn </docs/appendix_b/A.html#aleith-skyborn>`__. 
Its message was to turn everyone into mindless little cretins hell-bent on taking over the world - you know, like most cults.

However, the HMOB team bust down the door and kicked some ass without taking any names and destroyed all the followers. It was in the basement of the Black Sun's temple that they found the `Shard of Incabulos <items.html#the-shards-of-incabulos>`__.

Sadly, 
`Aleith </docs/appendix_b/A.html#aleith-skyborn>`__ 
didn't survive the encouter.

Daermon N'a'shezbaernon
***********************

Black market underground thieves organization throughout Rendahil.
Especially prevalent in The Principality of Mingia.

Flaming Fist Mercenaries
************************

Company of mercenaries who rigorously train until all soldiers are high
quality and battle-ready. Very competitive. Home to a lot of hot-heads.

Ouroboros Worshipperâ€™s Cult
***************************

This enterprising cult spent its time worshipping the cycle of birth,
death, and rebirth. The main focus of all its dark energy was an
artifact called The Bone of Doresain.

Realm of the Idiot God
**********************

These worshippers realize the folly in attempting to make oneself any
better than they presently find themselves. By supplicating to this god,
one is blessed to blunder through life as stupidly as they wish without
worrying about retribution of others.

Ytepka Society
**************

Primarily interested in restoring moral order in The Principality of
Mingia.
