Nobility Ranking
################

1)  **Emperor/Empress** - Ruler of a large country that devoured many
    kingdoms
2)  **King/Queen** - Ruler of a kingdom, can be large or not.
3)  **Duke/Duchess** - Ruler of a large region of an Empire or kingdom.
    Former royalty can be dukes.
4)  **Prince/Princess** - Heirs of the first 2 categories, sometimes
    3rd, too. No actual power, only potential, unless the country in
    question is a Princedom, in which case equates to King/Duke.
5)  **Marquess/Marquise** - Owner and governor of border regions. Have
    roughly equal official power as a Count, but more autonomy due to
    distance from capital and larger military (to defend from other
    countries).
6)  **Earl or Count/Countess** - Owner and governor of a piece of land.
7)  **Viscount/Viscountess** - Mostly honorary title, sometimes owning
    the land, but wielding less actual power. It's like Count-wannabe,
    literally vice-count.
8)  **Baron/Baroness** - Owner or governor of a small region. Not
    terribly different from Count, but might have less land or
    limitations on hereditary transfer of land ownership. Sometimes not
    even the owner of the land, but only the ruler/governor.
9)  **Baronet**

    1) a knight who has hereditary rights (his children would get the
       title automatically);
    2) an heir to a Baron/Baroness. Usually doesn't own/govern the land.

10) **Knight** - Non-hereditary title for a person recognized as
    nobility by the King/Duke.
