<p>Located some fifty miles from
<a class="reference external" href="notable_cities/kassoon.html">Kassoon</a>
, Gravesford is a village situated at the edge of civilization as far as the
<a class="reference external" href="other_locations.html#barony-of-bedegar">Barony of Bedegar</a>
is concerned, at least. There’s been a bridge across the River Graves, and a town around that, for as long
as anyone can remember and as far back as any records go. Folks know, or believe, that the bridge and the
<a class="reference external" href="/docs/notable_cities/gravesford.html#the-reluctant-pig">Reluctant Pig</a>
existed long before any other house in Gravesford, even the church, was built.</p>
<p>As in any countryside town, everyone in Gravesford knows everyone else, and word is quick to spread.
If newcomers - like the players — arrive in town and spend the night in the local inn, odds are the entire
population of two-hundred-odd villagers including nearby farmers will know by mid-morning. The town’s two
public buildings, the Reluctant Pig and the
<a class="reference external" href="/docs/notable_cities/gravesford.html#church-of-st-gaed">Church of St. Gaed the Confessor</a>
, are large enough for the entire town to crowd into for major celebrations like the harvest-tide feast
and candle festival of St. Gaed’s Feast.</p>
<p>Gravesford is separated from
<a class="reference external" href="/docs/other_locations.html#the-forest-rend">The Forest Rend</a>
, a rather dangerous forest known for all kinds of evil creatures, by the River Graves.</p>
<p>It is here that the players met
<a class="reference external" href="/docs/appendix_b/P.html#pinna-grayfall">Pinna</a>,
a young, rather strange wizard whose talents for research far outweigh even some of the
oldest and mightiest wizards.</p>

<h3>Church of St. Gaed<a class="headerlink" href="#church-of-st-gaed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Church of St. Gaed the Confessor is one of the oldest buildings in Gravesford, after the Reluctant Pig,
of course. Its wooden beams need repair, but it is still the cultural center of the village, and Gravesford
gathers here for all sorts of occasions, not just on holy days. The stained glass window depicting Saint Gaed
in black armor smiting the traitor saint, Hylae the Corrupt, is the most astonishing piece of art anyone in
town has ever seen. When the sun hits it, it’s like a laser light show.</p>
<p>The church is run by Father Belderone, a priest of St. Gaed. He is a city man from Bedegar Keep, and it’s
reflected in his rapid, matter-of-fact speech, but the villagers treat him as one of their own. While several
priests tend to the church, Father Belderone is its only cleric.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>In life Gaed was the chief confessor in a secret order of knights who ferreted out spies within the king’s
court.  Unbeknownst to anyone, the chief of those spies was a fiend, a devil under the command of an evil
saint.  Gaed exposed this devil and did battle with it. He lost the battle and his life, but exposed a deadly
conspiracy and saved the king and the kingdom. He forced the devil to reveal its true nature, and Cavall
canonized him immediately as the Confessor, saint of exposing secrets and foiling conspiracies. It was Gaed
who died at the hands of the devil spy. It was Saint Gaed the Confessor, now immortal, who returned and slew
the devil.</em></p>

<h3>The Reluctant Pig<a class="headerlink" href="#the-reluctant-pig" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The oldest building in Gravesford is the Reluctant Pig, a two-story inn with a moss-covered roof constructed
from the same stone as the Gravesford Bridge. The sign outside depicts a young pig straining against a leash
held by someone we cannot see. The sign has no text, as most people in town and most carters and journeymen
cannot read.</p>

<h3>Pinna’s Shop<a class="headerlink" href="#pinna-s-shop" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Owner:
<a class="reference external" href="/docs/appendix_b/P.html#pinna-grayfall">Pinna</a>,</p>
<p>The spicy-sweet scent of boiled licorice and anise seed billows from the smokestack of Pinna’s dome-roofed hut.
Other medicinal herbs hang by the doorway, like long garlic ropes and branches of flowering barberry.
Inside, she keeps a brass cauldron boiling at all times in the center of the room. Unkempt bookshelves overfilled
with tomes, scrolls, and bottles line the walls, and both chairs in the house sag under the weight of unwashed
clothing.</p>
<p>Pinna’s shop is also her one-room house. While at home, Pinna is usually doing at least three things at
once—brewing ointments, clipping shoots from herbs, and practicing charms, or any other combination of wizardly
activities. She only stops multitasking if another wizard enters her shop, at which point she drops everything
and focuses intently on them.</p>
<p>Pinna sells dozens of rustic herbal remedies for 5 cp apiece</p>
