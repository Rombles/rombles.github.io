</dd>
<dt>It’s a Rental</dt><dd><p>At <strong>Rank 1</strong>, at the start of any mission, you can requisition a
second-hand draft horse and cart (barely functional), riding horses and
ponies (typically well aged, one for each party member), passage on a
ship or ferry (might require minor labor as a part of the fare), and
similar transportation. Any damage or losses to requisitioned equipment
is expected to be repaid to Head Office.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Spyglass of Clairvoyance</dt><dd><p>A common magic item given to a cartographer by the Head Office of
Acquisitions Incorporated. As an action, you can look through the
spyglass of clairvoyance at a location within 1 mile of you that is
obstructing your view, such as a mountain, castle, or forest. You must
then succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom check using cartographer’s tools to map
the natural terrain found within three miles of that chosen point. You
do not gain any knowledge of creatures, structures, or anything other
than natural terrain. This property of the spyglass cannot be used again
until the next dawn.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tale of Safe Travel</dt><dd><p>Starting at <strong>Rank 2</strong>, you gain the ability to perform a 45-minute
ritual using your cartographer’s tools, maps, and 50gp in consumed
material components. By doing so, you ensure safe travel for you and
other creatures, from your current location to another location you
could normally reach within one day The destination must be one to which
you have traveled previously, or for which you have an accurate route
and map. If your tale is told with reverence and precision, you and up
to six other creatures plus their gear (including vehicles or mounts)
become encircled in a magical bubble and are pulled into the Border
Ethereal. During the ritual, you tell a story of your future journey,
relating the details of what will be seen en route. The DM can choose to
add to the story, imparting additional details or planting seeds for
future adventures. If you wish, the ritual can be ended early, allowing
the party to encounter what’s being described by the DM. Whenever the
ritual is ended or interrupted by you, all the travelers arrive safely
at the destination. At the DM’s discretion, all the travelers affected
by the ritual can gain the benefit of either a short rest or a long rest
during the voyage.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Map of Shortcuts</dt><dd><p>At <strong>Rank 3</strong>, your map case becomes a common magic item. In addition to
storing normal maps, your cartographer’s map case can be used to
generate a special map identifying a shortcut. You can use your action
to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, with a success revealing a
map buried in your cartographer’s map case noting a relevant shortcut.
Your travel time is reduced by half while you follow the route. If you
succeed at a check by 5 or map, the map includes notes on terrain giving
you advantage on the next ability check you make through the mapped area
in the next hour. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again
until you finish a long rest.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Map of the Moment</dt><dd><p>Starting at <strong>Rank 3</strong>, you can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom
(Perception) check and search your cartographer’s map case to find a map
either related to your current mission or inspiring a new one. On a
success, you find a map with a prominent landmark. The map has
information on the natural terrain within one mile of the landmark. Once
you use this feature, you cannot use it again until dawn seven days
later.</p>

<h3>Decisionist<a class="headerlink" href="#decisionist" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A decisionist brings decisive leadership to an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. They settle
disputes and ensure that the team moves forward towards its goals, often serving as a
leader (officially or otherwise) and compass for the party. A signature move of the decisionist
is to impress the importance of a particular looming choice on the other franchisees, then call
for a vote. The result of all franchise votes are recorded, then later reported to Head Office.
Decisionists are also concerned with franchise morale and teamwork, helping all members of the
franchise work together effectively.</p>
<p>All decisionists vary in their approach to the task. You might primarily attempt to convince
others through charismatic arguments, or through force of will or intellectual cunning. You
might lead by example, or by extolling the examples of other people who’ve done the things you
haven’t quite gotten around to yet. Many decisionists go on to publish famous tomes, such as the
best-selling <em>Habits of Effective Adventuring Parties</em> and <em>I Don’t Care If the Rogue Stole Your
Coins, We Have a Job to Do.</em> You help advance the franchise by calling for votes, making sure
you’re always on the side with the most votes, and resolving disputes within the franchise
party.</p>

<p>As a <strong>Rank 1</strong> decisionist, you gain proficiency with a musical instrument (horn). Head office
also grants you the use of a musical instrument (your choice of horn), a voting kit (ballots, a
ballot box, an “I Voted” sticker set), and a coin of decisionry. This large gold coin is
emblazoned with the sigil of Acquisitions Incorporated as “heads,” and has a “tails” image that

<p>The coin has absolutely no divination abilities, and its results when you use it are random. But
nobody else knows that. When a creature within 10 feet of you flips the coin (after having had
its powerful prognostication powers dutifully explained), you can exert your will to control its
operation as a bonus action, choosing the result that appears after it lands as a means of
gently coercing the user toward a specific course of action. The creature flipping the coin can
detect your manipulation with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (insight) check.</p>

<h3>Documancer<a class="headerlink" href="#documancer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Every great Acquisitions Incorporated quest begins with a contract from Head Office – and a
franchise’s documancer is most likely the one who controls and channels the power of that contract.
A documancer bears the responsibility of managing each of a franchise’s quests, of ensuring that
every condition of the quest is fulfilled, and of recording and sending on information vital to Head
Office when the mission is complete. When creating contracts with other organizations, a documancer
makes sure that the language benefits both the franchise and Acquisitions Incorporated.</p>
<p>As a documancer you are respected for having the commitment and mental fortitude required to
work with Head Office. You advance your franchise by using documancy for communication,
insisting on recording all details in writing, retaining records, destroying other records, and
recalling vital information.</p>

<p>Obstacles abound along the path to riches. A franchise’s mission success might require combating
a rival organization’s disinformation attempts one day, then besting a castle’s defenses are
next. The day after that, some poor sap named Bob might need to be disposed of. And no matter
what type of challenge that needs to be overcome, the franchise’s obviator determines the
optimal way to shut down and destroy that challenge. (Nothing personal, Bob. It’s just
business).</p>
<p>As an obviator, you hatch convoluted plans to fight the overwhelming odds presented by each
mission –by whatever means are necessary. Sometimes you might prefer brute strength over
improvisation, other times you might undertake a deep study of conflicts and rival
organizations, working carefully to stay three steps ahead of the opposition. In all cases,
though, you help advance your franchise by hatching effective plans and tactics, anticipating
problems, and learning about your foes – ideally before they can treat you as an obstacle to
their own success.</p>

<dt>Portfolio Keeper</dt><dd><p>At <strong>Rank 2</strong>, you gain the use of a weathered leather pouch that is an uncommon magic item. The
<em>portfolio keeper</em> holds and organizes notes, brochures, and business cards bearing your contact
information. It also has an inexhaustible scheme.</p>
<p>When you meet someone for the first time, their details and a rough sketch are magically stored
on a small parchment card in the <em>portfolio keeper</em>. You can access the details of any such
stored card as a bonus action.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Rumor Mill</dt><dd><p>Also at <strong>Rank 2</strong>, whenever your franchise begins a major quest or mission, make a DC 15
Intelligence (History) check. On a success, you can learn up to three rumors related to
creatures or organizations involved in the mission, which come to you through your <em>sending
stone</em>. These rumors reflect current or historical knowledge possessed by Acquisitions
Incorporated or the organization’s many contacts.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cards of Sending</dt><dd><p>At <strong>Rank 3</strong>, the power of your <em>portfolio keeper</em> becomes more potent, makin git a rare
magic item. When you give out a business card stored in your <em>portfolio keeper</em> you can
choose to have the card allow its recipient to contact you through your <em>sending stone</em> as
if they had a cast a <em>sending spell</em>. A business card loses this power seven days after it
has been given out no more than 5 cards can have this power at one time.</p>
<p>You can also use your <em>sending stone</em> to cast <em>sending</em> and contact anyone who has one of
your business cards. Once you use this feature of the stone, you cannot use it again until
dawn of the next day.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Improved Rumor Mill</dt><dd><p>At <strong>Rank 3</strong>, when you use your Rumor Mill feature, the DM provides you with a sense of
which parts of a particular rumor are inaccurate, if any. You do not necessarily learn
the truth behind those false rumors.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Always Hiring</dt><dd><p>At <strong>Rank 4</strong>, you have little trouble finding the right people for the job. As an action, while
in a populated area, you can make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to locate an NPC who can
provide a service immediately, no questions asked, for the standard fee. On a successful check,
information regarding the potential hire comes to you as supernatural insight, word of mouth, an
advertisement blowing into your face, or a similarly convenient method. Once you use this
feature you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>Hirelings acquired through this feature are in addition to any franchise staff. They can be
invited to bolster existing staff or fill a sudden need, but they are not of the baseline staff
gained through a franchise’s rank. Theyir pay is not covered by the franchise’s normal ones.</p>

<p>The tavern expansion allows for the accumulation of gold for
‘in-between-session’ adventurers. Every adventure accrues an amount of
gold, a percentage of which is held for adventurers who managed to miss
an episode or two. This provides players who have not always been around
to receive some share of the guild’s profits.</p>
<p>In order to increase the profitability of the tavern inside a guild
hall, improvements must be made to the underlying infrastructure -
better benches, newer taps, more ale selection, etc. These can be
purchased using the following table.</p>
