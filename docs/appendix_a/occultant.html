<p>An occultant tracks the creatures and foes that a franchise has bested or killed, weighing them
against the deeds the franchise has achieved. Using the eldritch abacus for which this position
is named, an occultant measures the karmic coordinates of their franchise, hoping to gain
portents of that which is yet to come.</p>
<p>Like all occultants, you are a grim and enigmatic figure. Even your closest companions might be
wary of the power you channel–and nobody wears that aura of dark mystery like you do. you help
advance your franchise by determining whether foes should live or die, prognosticating correctly
(or at least authoritatively), keeping the rest of the party attuned to the importance of karma,
and making the right calls on how to best “clean up” any incorrect readings or
misunderstandings.</p>

<dt>Read the Kill</dt><dd><p>Also at <strong>Rank 1</strong>, your occultant abacus not only tracks your franchise’s kills, it helps you
determine the impact of those kills on teh franchise’s fate. Over a period of 1 minute, you can
study a creature killed by someone in your franchise within the last 24 hours, then grant the
character who slew it a d10. Once within the next hour, that character can add teh d10 to an
attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. If it’s not clear who administered the killing
blow, you grant this benefit to a random creature involved in the fight. Once you use this
feature you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Eldritch Occultant</dt><dd><p>Starting at <strong>Rank 2</strong>, your occultant abacus becomes an uncommon magic item that can track
lives both eliminated and saved. While holding your <em>occultant abacus</em> within 5 feet of a
creature killed within the past 24 hours, you can cast the <em>augery</em> spell. The course of action
you inquire about with the spell does not need to have any connection to the dead creature. This
property of the <em>occultant abacus</em> can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bring Out Your Dead</dt><dd><p>Also at <strong>Rank 2</strong>,  you regain the use of your Read the Kill feature after you finish a short
or long rest.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bead of Instant Karma</dt><dd><p>At <strong>Rank 3</strong>, one of the beads on your <em>occultant abacus</em> channels the power of instant karma,
turning the <em>occultant abacus</em> into a rare magic item. As a reaction, you can target one
creature you can see that is about to attempt an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw,
either granting advantage or imposing disadvantage on the roll. The bead crumbles to dust when
used, reappearing on your <em>occultant abacus</em> at the next dawn.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Death’s Omen</dt><dd><p>Also at <strong>Rank 3</strong>, you gain the ability to read the grim portents of a creature’s demise. As a
bonus action, choose a creature you can see that is below its hit point maximum and make a DC 15
Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, you determine whether this creature’s immediate death
would have a neutral, negative, or positive ramifications for you and your franchise. If the
ramifications are different for you and the franchise, you learn this as well.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bead of Diverted Karma</dt><dd><p>At <strong>Rank 4</strong>, one of the beads on your <em>occultant abacus</em> allows you to divert karma to where
it’s needed, turning the <em>occultant abacus</em> into a very rare magic item. While the bead is
unused, you know automatically when any creature that you can see is about to make an ability
check, attack roll, or saving throw with disadvantage. When such a roll is made, you can use a
reaction to grant a d10 to a different creature you can see. That creature can add d10 to any
ability check, attack roll or saving throw it makes within the next minute. The bead crumbles to
dust when used, reappearing on your <em>occultant abacus</em> at the next dawn.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Correct the Balance</dt><dd><p>As a <strong>Rank 4</strong> occultant, you learn that sometimes the death of a creature has unintended
consequences. Within seven days of a creature’s death, you can use your <em>occultant abacus</em> to
divine ways to reverse or mitigate events resulting from that death. As an action, make a DC 15
Intelligence (Religion) check.  On a success, you learn the relevant information based on the
nature of the creature and its place in the world.</p>
<p>If you fail the check, this property of the <em>occultant abacus</em> can’t be used again until the
next dawn. If you succeed on the check, this property can’t be used again  until seven days
later.</p>
