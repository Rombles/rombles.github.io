<dt><em>I’ve sold ice in Icewind Dale.</em></dt><dd><p>-Secretarian’s boast</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A secretarian’s focus is on people–and all the potential value that might be wrung out of them.
Every person met outside a franchise is a potential customer to a secretarian, who does whatever
they can to bring the relationship to fulfillment. A secretarian seeks always to promote their
franchise and gain greater value than they give. They have the skills to negotiate with
subemployees, temporary hirelings, seasonal staff, and other humanoid (usually) resources. When
staff members have problems, the secretarian is teh one who patiently listens (or at least
pretends to) until everything calms down.</p>
<p>As a secretarian, you are respected for having the fortitude to listen to both customers and
coworkers without going insane. you help advance your franchise by keeping staff happy (enough),
hiring competent (enough) workers, coming up with slogans and catchphrases, launching marketing
schemes, and getting jingles and slogans stuck in customer’s heads. And while your superiors
don’t official condone undermining the branding efforts of other organizations, no one can argue
with the effictiveness of that approach.</p>

franchise.</p>
<p>As a <strong>Rank 1</strong> secretarian, you gain proficiency with one of the following of your choice:
gaming set, musical instrument, or disguise kit.</p>
<p>Head Office also grants you the use of a tool kit for your chosen proficiency, a collection of
sales brochures, a set of business cards, a metal bell, and a set of fine clothes.</p>

<dt>Sending Stone</dt><dd><p>Also at <strong>Rank 1</strong>, you are given use of an Acquisitions Incorporated <em>sending stone</em>, an
uncommon magic item that resembles a gemstone in a bold setting. It functions like a normal
<em>sending stone</em> except that it has no matching stone and allows communications with Head Office,
specific secretarians you know, and the secretarian nearest your location. you must succeed on a
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to establish contact. Once the stone is successfully, it can’t
be used again until the next dawn.</p>
<p>Making contact with another secretarian assumes that they are in possession of their own
<em>sending stone</em>.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Portfolio Keeper</dt><dd><p>At <strong>Rank 2</strong>, you gain the use of a weathered leather pouch that is an uncommon magic item. The
<em>portfolio keeper</em> holds and organizes notes, brochures, and business cards bearing your contact
information. It also has an inexhaustible scheme.</p>
<p>When you meet someone for the first time, their details and a rough sketch are magically stored
on a small parchment card in the <em>portfolio keeper</em>. You can access the details of any such
stored card as a bonus action.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Rumor Mill</dt><dd><p>Also at <strong>Rank 2</strong>, whenever your franchise begins a major quest or mission, make a DC 15
Intelligence (History) check. On a success, you can learn up to three rumors related to
creatures or organizations involved in the mission, which come to you through your <em>sending
stone</em>. These rumors reflect current or historical knowledge possessed by Acquisitions
Incorporated or the organization’s many contacts.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cards of Sending</dt><dd><p>At <strong>Rank 3</strong>, the power of your <em>portfolio keeper</em> becomes more potent, makin git a rare
magic item. When you give out a business card stored in your <em>portfolio keeper</em> you can
choose to have the card allow its recipient to contact you through your <em>sending stone</em> as
if they had a cast a <em>sending spell</em>. A business card loses this power seven days after it
has been given out no more than 5 cards can have this power at one time.</p>
<p>You can also use your <em>sending stone</em> to cast <em>sending</em> and contact anyone who has one of
your business cards. Once you use this feature of the stone, you cannot use it again until
dawn of the next day.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Improved Rumor Mill</dt><dd><p>At <strong>Rank 3</strong>, when you use your Rumor Mill feature, the DM provides you with a sense of
which parts of a particular rumor are inaccurate, if any. You do not necessarily learn
the truth behind those false rumors.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Always Hiring</dt><dd><p>At <strong>Rank 4</strong>, you have little trouble finding the right people for the job. As an action, while
in a populated area, you can make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to locate an NPC who can
provide a service immediately, no questions asked, for the standard fee. On a successful check,
information regarding the potential hire comes to you as supernatural insight, word of mouth, an
advertisement blowing into your face, or a similarly convenient method. Once you use this
feature you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>Hirelings acquired through this feature are in addition to any franchise staff. They can be
invited to bolster existing staff or fill a sudden need, but they are not of the baseline staff
gained through a franchise’s rank. Theyir pay is not covered by the franchise’s normal ones.</p>
