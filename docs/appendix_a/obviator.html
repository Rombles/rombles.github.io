<dt><em>I adjust the odds and remove obstacles to create maximum convenience for our franchise</em></dt><dd><p>- Obviator creed</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Obstacles abound along the path to riches. A franchise’s mission success might require combating
a rival organization’s disinformation attempts one day, then besting a castle’s defenses are
next. The day after that, some poor sap named Bob might need to be disposed of. And no matter
what type of challenge that needs to be overcome, the franchise’s obviator determines the
optimal way to shut down and destroy that challenge. (Nothing personal, Bob. It’s just
business).</p>
<p>As an obviator, you hatch convoluted plans to fight the overwhelming odds presented by each
mission –by whatever means are necessary. Sometimes you might prefer brute strength over
improvisation, other times you might undertake a deep study of conflicts and rival
organizations, working carefully to stay three steps ahead of the opposition. In all cases,
though, you help advance your franchise by hatching effective plans and tactics, anticipating
problems, and learning about your foes – ideally before they can treat you as an obstacle to
their own success.</p>

<p>As a <strong>Rank 1</strong> obviator, you gain proficiency with alchemist’s supplies.</p>
<p>Head Office also grants you the use of alchemist’s supplies (two glass beakers, a metal frame to
hold a beaker in place over an open flame, a glass stirring rod, a small mortar and pestle, and
a poiuch of common alchemical ingredients including salt, powdered iron, and purified water);
your choice of a vial of acid, a flask of alchemist’s fire, or a vial of antitoxin; and a
hunting trap.</p>

<dt>Read the Opposition</dt><dd><p>Also at <strong>Rank 1</strong>, you can attempt to get a reading on one creature you can see, trying to
learn useful information about it. As a bonus action, make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a
success, you learn three details of your choice about the creature. Once you use this feature,
you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature only once on any
creature.</p>
<p>Possible details you might learn include the creature’s goals or motivation, bonds or ideals,
personality traits, flaws, combat strategy (including common attack methods or tactics),
financial information, lair location, allies or foes, romantic entanglements, sense of humor, or
favorite songs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Alchemist’s Insight</dt><dd><p>At <strong>Rank 2</strong>, you can use an action to use your alchemist’s supplies to identify any unknown
substance (including alchemical items, potions, and other magical substances). Once you use this
feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Obviator’s Lenses</dt><dd><p>Also at <strong>Rank 2</strong>, you gain the use of an uncommon magic item taking the form of a pair of
spectacles, a spyglass, a monocle, or any other device with one or two lenses. When you look
through the <em>obviator’s lenses</em>, you use a bonus action to make them function as <em>eyes of minute
seeing</em> or <em>eyes of the eagle</em>. Once you make this choice, it cannot be changed until the next
dawn.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Advance Preparations</dt><dd><p>At <strong>Rank 3</strong>, you gain the ability to declare that you’re totally prepared. This preparedness
takes the form of asking yourself one question, then making a DC 15 Intelligence (History)
check. On a success, you recall information that could have been uncovered through earlier
research about your mission. The information can be discreet revelation, a vague hint, or even a
riddle. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you have finished a long rest.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Travel Alchemical Kit</dt><dd><p>Also at <strong>Rank 3</strong>, Head Office provides you with a travel alchemical kit–an uncommon magic
item containing miniaturized versions of both alchemist’s supplies and a poisoner’s kit (glass
vials, a mortar and pestle, chemicals, and a glass stirring rod). You gain proficiency with a
poisoner’s kit as a part of this upgrade.</p>
<p>You can use this magical kit as long as it is on your person, with no need to draw or stow it.
If you are ever searched, finding your travel alchemical kit requires a successful DC 20
Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Insight) check.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Enhanced Lenses</dt><dd><p>At <strong>Rank 4</strong>, your <em>obviator’s lenses</em> gain additional power and become a rare magic item. The
lenses now function as both <em>eyes of the eagle</em> and <em>eyes of minute seeing</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can focus the power of the lenses to gain accuracy in combat, gaining
advantage on a weapon attack roll (no action required). If that attack hits, roll one additional
weapon damage die. This property of the lenses cannot be used again until the next dawn.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Obviate the Opposition</dt><dd><p>Also at <strong>Rank 4</strong>, when you use your Read the Opposition feature and fail the check, you still
learn one detail about the target creature, as chosen by the Dm. Additionally, you can use Read
the Opposition more than once on the same creature, but if you do so you cannot use this feature
again on teh same creature until you finish a long rest.</p>
