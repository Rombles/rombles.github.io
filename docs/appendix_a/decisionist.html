<h1>Decisionist<a class="headerlink" href="#decisionist" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A decisionist brings decisive leadership to an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. They settle
disputes and ensure that the team moves forward towards its goals, often serving as a
leader (officially or otherwise) and compass for the party. A signature move of the decisionist
is to impress the importance of a particular looming choice on the other franchisees, then call
for a vote. The result of all franchise votes are recorded, then later reported to Head Office.
Decisionists are also concerned with franchise morale and teamwork, helping all members of the
franchise work together effectively.</p>
<p>All decisionists vary in their approach to the task. You might primarily attempt to convince
others through charismatic arguments, or through force of will or intellectual cunning. You
might lead by example, or by extolling the examples of other people who’ve done the things you
haven’t quite gotten around to yet. Many decisionists go on to publish famous tomes, such as the
best-selling <em>Habits of Effective Adventuring Parties</em> and <em>I Don’t Care If the Rogue Stole Your
Coins, We Have a Job to Do.</em> You help advance the franchise by calling for votes, making sure
you’re always on the side with the most votes, and resolving disputes within the franchise
party.</p>

<dt>Essential Functions:</dt><dd><p>Receive one extra vote on franchise matters; resolve interpersonal conflicts</p>

<dt>Position Proficiency:</dt><dd><p>In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can add your proficiency bonus to an ability
check to influence a decision being made by a group, assess the popularity of certain customs or
individuals, or boost the morale of franchise hirelings.</p>
<p>As a <strong>Rank 1</strong> decisionist, you gain proficiency with a musical instrument (horn). Head office
also grants you the use of a musical instrument (your choice of horn), a voting kit (ballots, a
ballot box, an “I Voted” sticker set), and a coin of decisionry. This large gold coin is
emblazoned with the sigil of Acquisitions Incorporated as “heads,” and has a “tails” image that
varies.</p>

<p>The coin has absolutely no divination abilities, and its results when you use it are random. But
nobody else knows that. When a creature within 10 feet of you flips the coin (after having had
its powerful prognostication powers dutifully explained), you can exert your will to control its
operation as a bonus action, choosing the result that appears after it lands as a means of
gently coercing the user toward a specific course of action. The creature flipping the coin can
detect your manipulation with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (insight) check.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Better Odds</dt><dd><p>When you reach <strong>Rank 3</strong>, your <em>coin of decisionry</em> gains a measure of actual divination power
and becomes an uncommon magic item and becomes an uncommon magic item. In addition to its normal
function, you can use an action to flip the <em>coin of decisionry</em> twice while pondering a
specific plan or objective, noting both random results. If you succeed a DC 15 Intelligence
(Arcana) check, you learn which of the two results is more applicable to the course of action.
This property of the coin can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inspired Decision</dt><dd><p>Starting at <strong>Rank 3</strong>, whenever a serious franchise vote is taken and the result goes the way
you voted, you can inspire the rest of the franchise team with a brief speech. Make a DC 15
Charisma (Perception) check. On a success, each franchise member of your choice who can hear you
gains advantage on the next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make in the next
hour. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Charming Misdemeanor</dt><dd><p>As a <strong>Rank 4</strong> decisionist, you can present your <em>coin of decisionry</em> to grant yourself an
extra vote when your franchise votes, for a total of three votes. Once you do so, you cannot do
so again until dawn seven days later.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Clandestine Kit</dt><dd><p>As a <strong>Rank 4</strong>, your voting kit becomes a common magic item that conceals an extradimensional
space. As a bonus action, you can place one tool kit that you are proficient with into the
<em>voting kit</em>, or can remove it. No other type of object can be placed into the extradimensional
space. A creature searching the <em>voting kit</em> finds an extracts the tool kit with a successful DC
20 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can use the <em>voting kit</em> to cast <em>charm person</em> (save DC 15). This property of
the kit can’t be used again until next dawn.</p>
