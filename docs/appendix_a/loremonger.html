</dl>
<p>Information has value, and the loremonger is that information’s keeper. A franchise’s loremonger studies
and records all lore relevant to its operation, including tracking the economic, technical, and arcane
methods by which the franchise can be improved. A loremonger records the deeds and history of
the franchise, including the names of places visited and people met during missions. Those
records are then sent to Head Office (often through a franchise’s documancer) to ensure  brand
integrity.</p>
<p>As a loremonger, you are a studious individual, usually with an interest in history or technical
subjects. you might revel in your role, working as a central figure in your franchise as you use
your knowledge to promote it. Or you might operate from the shadows, resembling a clever
spymaster and allowing others to be the franchise’s public face. You help advance your franchise
by discovering secrets, tracking important lore gained during the characters’ travels, and
reporting on competitors’ goals and methods.</p>

<dt>Whisper Jar</dt><dd><p>Also at <strong>Rank 1</strong>, you are the beneficiary of a <em>whisper jar</em> - a common magic item resembling
an ether-filled jar with a long tap hose. The jar is used to record others’ stories and your own
observations, like a verbal notebook with unlimited space. The <em>whisper jar</em> records as fast as
a creature can speak into it, and whispers back words at the same pace they were recorded.
Activating the playback of a particular recording is an action.</p>

specific subject and make a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check. On a success, the jar plays back
a recording on that subject, made somewhere, sometime by another Acq Inc loremonger. This
property of the <em>whisper jar</em> cannot be used again until the next dawn.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Construction Permits</dt><dd><p>At <strong>Rank 3</strong>, your knowledge of best practices for improving an Acquisitions Incorporated

above those gained normally through franchise advancement.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Whispered Warnings</dt><dd><p>Also at <strong>Rank 3</strong>, your <em>whisper jar</em> gains additional power and becomes a rare magic item. As

<dt>Whispered Arcana</dt><dd><p>Also at <strong>Rank 4</strong>, your <em>whisper jar</em> gains access to even more magic. By whispering the name

<em>detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, find traps, identify, or locate
animals or plants</em>. This property of the <em>whisper jar</em> cannot be used again until the next dawn.</p>
