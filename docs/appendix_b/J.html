<h1>Jacob Ashbridge, Baron<a class="headerlink" href="#jacob-ashbridge-baron" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A garish baron with an exceedingly large plantation on the outskirts of
<a class="reference external" href="../notable_cities.html#kassoon">Kassoon.</a> Recently he’s decided to spend his fortune ensuring that he and
his wife <a class="reference external" href="P.html#persephone-ashbridge-baroness">Persephone Ashbridge</a> live throughout eternity resting in wild
and difficult locations. Having sought out <a class="reference external" href="../other_locations.html#the-tomb-of-the-meridian-lord">The Tomb of the Meridian Lord,</a>
he and his wife <a class="reference external" href="P.html#persephone-ashbridge-baroness">Persephone</a> have bitten off more than they can chew
when a deadly poltergeist and a devious carrion crawler halt construction.</p>
<p>After the Adventurers successfully returned <a class="reference external" href="P.html#persephone-ashbridge-baroness">Persephone Ashbridge</a> to him,
he told the players that he’s always got work for reliable employees.</p>

<h1>Jim Darkmagic<a class="headerlink" href="#jim-darkmagic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Have a magical day!</p>
<p>Jim Winifred Darkmagic III is the scion of a mysterious, multiplanar
wizarding family. Jim’s arcane pedigree has long preceded him,
incorporating equally healthy amounts of magical training and innate
eldritch prowess. However, despite a natural talent that could have
allowed him to make a name for himself as a court wizard, or perhaps
“that strange old man in the village,” Jim’s original penchant was not
for the magic of scroll or spell, but for the stage.</p>
<p>As an entertainer and purveyor of the “Jim Darkmagic Experience,” the
legendary mage can often be found in markets and town squares,
performing features of mundane legerdemain. The renown he has earned for
these feats is nearly equaled by the reputation that follows him as
chief arcanist (and occasional arsonist) for Acquisitions Incorporated.
And although his skills as an adventurer and real wizard remain highly
sought after, Jim looks forward to a well-earned retirement, at which
point he hopes to become a “real wizard” – by which he means a fake
wizard – full time.</p>
<p>Jim Darkmagic (High Elf) is the owner/CEO of the Acquisitions
Incorporated (AI) company, which franchised Hot Mess of Brie out of the
city of Kasoon</p>
<p>Not much is known about Jim Darkmagic other than he is a very powerful
wizard, known for using the magic at-will to momentarily inconvenience
other during regular conversations. Additionally Darkmagic has been
known to perform powerful ritualistic magic. In the beginning of the
Incorporation of Hot Mess of Brie, he and a few other mages teleported
the entire Ouroboros Temple to the city of <a class="reference external" href="../notable_cities.html#kassoon">Kassoon</a> to make it more
readily accessible to a town.</p>
<p>Jim Darkmagic publicly resents the influence that <a class="reference external" href="F.html#grand-vizer-faen">The Grand Vizer Faen</a>
has on all local politics (and thus AI)</p>

<h1>Jolruzai Runzehr<a class="headerlink" href="#jolruzai-runzehr" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Overseer of plant sales and assassinations merchant lord in <a class="reference external" href="../notable_cities.html#kassoon">Kassoon.</a></p>
<p>Informed by <a class="reference external" href="K.html#kirnih-oceantalon">Kirnih Oceantalon</a>,
owner of <a class="reference external" href="../notable_cities.html#a-florists-delight">A Florist’s Delight,</a>
that <a class="reference external" href="../notable_cities.html#boxwood-clovers">Boxwood Clovers</a> was a new,
unregulated business on the scene. In response, she
tightened import regulations and sent agents undercover to threaten
<a class="reference external" href="T.html#tifter-and-tiffany-valeure">Tifter</a> into submitting
to her commercial control. When nothing changed,
it was <a class="reference external" href="Z.html#zhanti">Zhanti</a> who convinced her to do nothing. In exchange for tax-free
armour for her assassins, Jolruzai would no longer interfere with <a class="reference external" href="../notable_cities.html#boxwood-clovers">Boxwood Clovers.</a></p>
<p>Jolruzai grew more frustrated that a new business (that she didn’t
control) was hoarding a big proportion of the plant market’s money. With
a little persuasion from the local stall holders, she granted <a class="reference external" href="K.html#kirnih-oceantalon">Kirnih</a>
a sanction to kill <a class="reference external" href="T.html#tifter-and-tiffany-valeure">Tifter</a>
by poison, her specialty. <a class="reference external" href="K.html#kirnih-oceantalon">Kirnih’s</a>
poison, however, only sent <a class="reference external" href="T.html#tifter-and-tiffany-valeure">Tifter</a> to sleep.</p>
