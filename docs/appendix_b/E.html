<h1>Edmund Bedegar<a class="headerlink" href="#edmund-bedegar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Son of <a class="reference external" href="B.html#lord-bedegar">Lord Bedegar</a>.</p>
<p>Edmund Bedegar is thirteen years old and the last of the Bedegar line. He is small and his voice is still
cracking and peaking, but a perceptive person can see in his eyes the steely resolve of a confident ruler.</p>
<p>Edmund’s older brother was to be the next baron, but as is traditional Edmund trained next to his brother in
all things. He learned falconry, jousting, how to host a dinner, the proper ways to address a duke, a king,
a count, or another baron. He idolized his older brother and expected to serve as his squire this next year, and
then become chancellor of his court once his brother ascended to the barony. That was before
<a class="reference external" href="/docs/religions_and_organizations.html#white-tusk-orcs">White Tusk Orcs</a>
came.</p>
<p>Now, Edmund is the rightful Baron of
<a class="reference external" href="other_locations.html#barony-of-bedegar">Bedegar</a>
by birthright, and he knows it. This is a tragedy, something he never wanted. And though he cries at night
for his dead family, he staves off despair by focusing on his commitment to upholding the family name, and
becoming the leader he knows his family would want. He intends to honor his father and brother, his mother
and sisters, by ruling where they cannot. This is the steel inside young Edmund.</p>
<p>He knows his station and expects to be treated with the respect his title deserves, but he is not a petulant
child. He is a young lord with a kind heart and an ingrained sense of justice. He rightfully fears the orcs
that kidnapped him, every night remembering his family dying under their axes.</p>
<p>He continually reminds himself, I am Baron now, what would my father do? The health of the barony must come
first. And Dorokor would make as powerful an ally as she has been an enemy. He wants revenge, but not as much
as he wants to be the kind of savvy ruler his father was. When he discovers that his father’s friend,
<a class="reference external" href="S.html#lord-saxton">Lord Saxton</a>
, is the architect of the night his family died, he may set his hatred of the orcs aside and turn his ire upon
the true mastermind.</p>
<p>Throughout his tenure with the White Tusk, he forged a special bond and knowing respect with
<a class="reference external" href="/docs/appendix_b/D.html#blood-chieftain-dorokor">Blood Chieftain Dorokor</a>
. Although their time together was brief, she taught him that might isn’t always the best way to rule and that
even the mighty have to think about their actions if they want to maintain the respect of those that serve.</p>
