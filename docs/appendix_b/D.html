<h1>Daronith Oakenthane<a class="headerlink" href="#daronith-oakenthane" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A wealthy miner, Daronith discovered the voidwater mine
while digging for gold. Experienced in deep-shaft mining, she
oversaw the construction of the complex machinery that punches down into a large
underground hcamber, opening up new caverns where pools of voidwater flow
freely. Daronith is a middle-aged woman with silvery black hair and a rough
complexion. She is highly ambitious and is eager to return the mine to
operation.</p>

<h1>Blood Chieftain Dorokor<a class="headerlink" href="#blood-chieftain-dorokor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Blood Chieftain Dorokor, Bonebreaker Dorokor to those she rules, commands the unquestioning loyalty of the
<a class="reference external" href="/docs/religions_and_organizations.html#white-tusk-orcs">White Tusk Orc Clan</a>
. She stands nearly seven feet tall and lifts her wicked greataxe, Wound, with ease. Her clan respects her
leadership as well as her might. Dorokor is a crafty and strategic warrior. Her plots and schemes are
sophisticated—her bargain with
<a class="reference external" href="S.html#lord-saxton">Lord Saxton</a>
is the first one to backfire, causing her people to question her leadership a little. But her people
believe that taking young
<a class="reference external" href="E.html#edmund-bedegar">Edmund Bedegar</a>
, the baron’s son, hostage is a feat that shows she thinks much farther ahead than a normal orc.</p>
<p>Her fanatical devotion to
<a class="reference external" href="/docs/gods.html#grole">Grole</a>
is both her greatest strength and her greatest weakness. Her zeal for Grole has driven her to become
strong and self-sufficient, but it has also made her exploitable. Lord Saxton manipulated her into
slaughtering the
<a class="reference external" href="B.html#lord-bedegar">Baron of Bedegar</a>
and his family by promising her the Sanguineous Oriflamme, an artifact of Grole that the old baron’s
forefathers took from the orcs decades ago.</p>
<p>Dorokor could not resist Saxton’s offer. She accepted the deal and mustered her tribe. Saxton’s men opened the
gates of
<a class="reference external" href="/docs/other_locations.html#bedegar-keep">Bedegar Keep</a>
and the White Tusk orcs stormed in, mercilessly slaughtering all within—except one young boy. Dorokor was no
fool and could sense that Saxton was a snake. She spared the life of young Edmund Bedegar and spirited him
away to
<a class="reference external" href="/docs/other_locations.html#castle-rend">Castle Rend</a>.
, the derelict fortress that the White Tusk orcs call home. She is keeping the young lordling as insurance
against Lord Saxton’s treachery. She believes—and she is correct — that if she produces the boy at the right
place and time, the humans will rebel against the usurper Saxton. She doesn’t particularly care who rules,
she just wants the Oriflamme.</p>
<p>Despite her cunning, Dorokor knows little of the ways of human diplomacy. She assumes that humans are weak
and, should you capture one, they will give up much to recover them. During the adventure, she initiates
negotiations in the same way that Saxton dealt with her: she kidnaps a young woman from the nearby town of
<a class="reference external" href="/docs/notable_cities/gravesford.html">Gravesford</a>
and will only release her if they agree to parley. Dorokor’s Common is simple but fluent. When speaking in Orc,
however, she uses grandiose and often poetic turns of phrase.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>Bonebreaker Dorokor wants to see her clan triumph over all others, including Men and elves. She has
ambition beyond any normal bloodchief. She also seeks to honor Grole with glorious victories in combat
and is often torn between her desire to protect her clan and her hunger for war.</em></p>
