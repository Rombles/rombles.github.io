<h2>Jim Darkmagic<a class="headerlink" href="#jim-darkmagic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Have a magical day!</p>
<p>Jim Winifred Darkmagic III is the scion of a mysterious, multiplanar
wizarding family. Jim’s arcane pedigree has long preceded him,
incorporating equally healthy amounts of magical training and innate
eldritch prowess. However, despite a natural talent that could have
allowed him to make a name for himself as a court wizard, or perhaps
“that strange old man in the village,” Jim’s original penchant was not
for the magic of scroll or spell, but for the stage.</p>
<p>As an entertainer and purveyor of the “Jim Darkmagic Experience,” the
legendary mage can often be found in markets and town squares,
performing features of mundane legerdemain. The renown he has earned for
these feats is nearly equaled by the reputation that follows him as
chief arcanist (and occasional arsonist) for Acquisitions Incorporated.
And although his skills as an adventurer and real wizard remain highly
sought after, Jim looks forward to a well-earned retirement, at which
point he hopes to become a “real wizard” – by which he means a fake
wizard – full time.</p>
<p>Jim Darkmagic (High Elf) is the owner/CEO of the Acquisitions
Incorporated (AI) company, which franchised Hot Mess of Brie out of the
city of Kasoon</p>
<p>Not much is known about Jim Darkmagic other than he is a very powerful
wizard, known for using the magic at-will to momentarily inconvenience
other during regular conversations. Additionally Darkmagic has been
known to perform powerful ritualistic magic. In the beginning of the
Incorporation of Hot Mess of Brie, he and a few other mages teleported
the entire Ouroboros Temple to the city of <a class="reference external" href="notable_cities.html#kassoon">Kassoon</a> to make it more
readily accessible to a town.</p>
<p>Jim Darkmagic publicly resents the influence that <a class="reference external" href="appendix_b.html#grand-vizer-faen">The Grand Vizer Faen</a>
has on all local politics (and thus AI)</p>

<p>Wife of <a class="reference external" href="appendix_b.html#jacob-ashbridge-baron">Baron Jacob Ashbridge,</a>
Persephone is a shrewd and wicked woman.  She is a thoroughly distasteful

<h2>Tifter and Tiffany Valeure<a class="headerlink" href="#tifter-and-tiffany-valeure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Tifter and Tiffany were born to middle class human parents Hortiff and
Yasmina Valeure, two mercenaries stationed in the city of Waterdeep. The
jobs paid well, and so the two children never wanted for anything. It
had always been a family tradition that when a child comes of age (18),
they must flee the nest to train at another mercenary encampment,
believing that a new “cultural experience” is good for the soul.</p>
<p>Tifter was never a good soldier – he was too busy jumping on the newest
bandwagon for personal glory to worry about the “greater good”. However,
to ensure a good allowance was maintained from his parents, he agreed to
travel to the Flaming Fist Camp in <a class="reference external" href="other_locations.html#kernwith-keep">Kernwith Keep</a>
to “really make a difference to the impoverished peninsula”. Tifter never made it to
<a class="reference external" href="other_locations.html#kernwith-keep">Kernwith Keep,</a> instead enamoured
by the commerce and excitement of <a class="reference external" href="notable_cities.html#kassoon">Kassoon.</a>
He decided to open a flower shop selling Boxwood Clovers. The clovers were
a hit with the locals, quickly becoming known for its beautiful scent and
unique colourings. Tifter set up shop in the <a class="reference external" href="notable_cities.html#kassoon">Kassoon.</a>
town center the place to be if you were going to sell anything.</p>
<p>Tifter met <a class="reference external" href="appendix_b.html#krissa-dicant">Kris Dicant,</a> a traveller “looking for work”. Their
relationship quickly spiralled from there. First lovers and then
friends, the pair ended up becoming business partners for the successful
shop, now named <a class="reference external" href="notable_cities.html#boxwood-clovers">Boxwood Clovers.</a>
As Tifter’s luck would have it, <a class="reference external" href="appendix_b.html#krissa-dicant">Kris</a> is
in fact a member of
<a class="reference external" href="religions_and_organizations.html#daermon-n-a-shezbaernon">Daermon N’a’shezbaernon,</a>
an underground spy network seeking wealth wherever they can. <a class="reference external" href="appendix_b.html#krissa-dicant">Kris,</a>
themself is part of the search for the <a class="reference external" href="items.html#ring-of-frost">Ring of Frost,</a>
a magical item rumoured to render someone invincible. When they realised the
search was fruitless, they decided to park the endeavour for a bit to focus on
something more interesting – money. <a class="reference external" href="notable_cities.html#boxwood-clovers">Boxwood Clovers.</a>
had unfortunately had a few robberies in recent months, and Tifter had been followed
home on a number of occasions by people trying to find out where the stash
of flowers was stored.</p>
<p>Eventually it was decided that the shop needed protection – <a class="reference external" href="appendix_b.html#krissa-dicant">Kris</a>
quickly provided 9 guards for the work.</p>

from <a class="reference external" href="appendix_b.html#jolruzai-runzehr">Jolruzai</a> by offering a favorable
trade in exchange for no longer looking to extract money from the
business. Zhanti had found the taste for money again and began to demand
a percentage of profits from the business. While <a class="reference external" href="appendix_b.html#krissa-dicant">Kris</a>
remained strong at first, their resolve weakened and they began to feel the pressure to
earn more money.</p>
