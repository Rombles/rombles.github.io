<p>Calador found The Bone of Dorsain - a legendary magical artifact used to
worship the Ouroboros Snake in the cult temple of life, death, and
rebirth The Ouroboros Temple. He met the adventuring party when Winsom
Landy hired the adventurers to help escort a magical artifact back to
civilization for identification and eventual resell.</p>
<p>The Bone of Dorsain, however, was full of incredibly potent necrotic
energy and eventually drove Calador mad, causing him to crave humanoid
flesh. Throughout the adventure her turned all of his compatriots into
ghouls under his control.</p>
<p>After being defeated by The Hot Mess of Brie team, he was brought back
from the beyond as a spectre by Jim Darkmagic (as a kind of cruel joke
or otherwise) to perform as the Guild Administrator for The Hot Mess of
Brie.</p>
<p>He is not well known to do his administrative duties effectively. He
also refers to all those living inside The Ouroboros Temple
(Headquarters) as trespassers.</p>

<h2>Jim Darkmagic<a class="headerlink" href="#jim-darkmagic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Have a magical day!</p>
<p>Jim Winifred Darkmagic III is the scion of a mysterious, multiplanar
wizarding family. Jim’s arcane pedigree has long preceded him,
incorporating equally healthy amounts of magical training and innate
eldritch prowess. However, despite a natural talent that could have
allowed him to make a name for himself as a court wizard, or perhaps
“that strange old man in the village,” Jim’s original penchant was not
for the magic of scroll or spell, but for the stage.</p>
<p>As an entertainer and purveyor of the “Jim Darkmagic Experience,” the
legendary mage can often be found in markets and town squares,
performing features of mundane legerdemain. The renown he has earned for
these feats is nearly equaled by the reputation that follows him as
chief arcanist (and occasional arsonist) for Acquisitions Incorporated.
And although his skills as an adventurer and real wizard remain highly
sought after, Jim looks forward to a well-earned retirement, at which
point he hopes to become a “real wizard” – by which he means a fake
wizard – full time.</p>
<p>Jim Darkmagic (High Elf) is the owner/CEO of the Acquisitions
Incorporated (AI) company, which franchised Hot Mess of Brie out of the
city of Kasoon</p>
<p>Not much is known about Jim Darkmagic other than he is a very powerful
wizard, known for using the magic at-will to momentarily inconvenience
other during regular conversations. Additionally Darkmagic has been
known to perform powerful ritualistic magic. In the beginning of the
Incorporation of Hot Mess of Brie, he and a few other mages teleported
the entire Ouroboros Temple to the city of Kassoon to make it more
readily accessible to a town.</p>
<p>Jim Darkmagic publicly resents the influence that The Grand Vizer Faen
has on all local politics (and thus AI)</p>

<p>Overseer of plant sales and assassinations merchant lord in Kassoon.</p>
<p>Informed by Kirnih Oceantalon, owner of A Florist’s Delight, that Boxes
of Clover was a new, unregulated business on the scene. In response, she
tightened import regulations and sent agents undercover to threaten
Tifter into submitting to her commercial control. When nothing changed,
it was Zhanti who convinced her to do nothing. In exchange for tax-free
armour for her assassins, Jolruzai would no longer interfere with Boxes
of Clover.</p>
<p>Jolruzai grew more frustrated that a new business (that she didn’t
control) was hoarding a big proportion of the plant market’s money. With
a little persuasion from the local stall holders, she granted Kirnih a
sanction to kill Tifter by poison, her specialty. Kirnih’s poison,

<h2>Tifter and Tiffany Valeure<a class="headerlink" href="#tifter-and-tiffany-valeure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Tifter and Tiffany were born to middle class human parents Hortiff and
Yasmina Valeure, two mercenaries stationed in the city of Waterdeep. The
jobs paid well, and so the two children never wanted for anything. It
had always been a family tradition that when a child comes of age (18),
they must flee the nest to train at another mercenary encampment,
believing that a new “cultural experience” is good for the soul.</p>
<p>Tifter was never a good soldier – he was too busy jumping on the newest
bandwagon for personal glory to worry about the “greater good”. However,
to ensure a good allowance was maintained from his parents, he agreed to
travel to the Flaming Fist Camp in Kernwith Keep to “really make a
difference to the impoverished peninsula”. Tifter never made it to
Kernwith Keep, instead enamoured by the commerce and excitement of
Kassoon. He decided to open a flower shop selling Boxwood Clovers. The
clovers were a hit with the locals, quickly becoming known for its
beautiful scent and unique colourings. Tifter set up shop in the Kassoon
town center the place to be if you were going to sell anything.</p>
<p>Tifter met Kris Dicant, a traveller “looking for work”. Their
relationship quickly spiralled from there. First lovers and then
friends, the pair ended up becoming business partners for the successful
shop, now named Boxes of Clover. As Tifter’s luck would have it, Kris is
in fact a member of Daermon N’a’shezbaernon, an underground spy network
seeking wealth wherever they can. Kris themself is part of the search
for the Ring of Frost, a magical item rumoured to render someone
invincible. When they realised the search was fruitless, they decided to
park the endeavour for a bit to focus on something more interesting –
money. Boxes of Clover had unfortunately had a few robberies in recent
months, and Tifter had been followed home on a number of occasions by
people trying to find out where the stash of flowers was stored.
Eventually it was decided that the shop needed protection – Kris quickly
provided 9 guards for the work.</p>

<p>Principal motivation as a merchant lord after money is restoring moral
order through the peninsula’s secret Ytepka Society. She’s one of the
society’s contacts with Daermon N’a’shezbaernon, and has thus been

<p>Zhanti protected Boxwood Clovers from Jolruzai by offering a favorable
trade in exchange for no longer looking to extract money from the
business. Zhanti had found the taste for money again and began to demand
a percentage of profits from the business. While Kris remained strong at
first, their resolve weakened and they began to feel the pressure to
earn more money.</p>
